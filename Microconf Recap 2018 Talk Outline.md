Last year, I took the official recap notes for every talk in Microconf Starter. This talk is a recap of the main themes I saw coming up over and over last year. If you like what you hear in the next 12 minutes, check out my full recaps on every talk from last year at microconf.gen.co (I'll show you that url again at the end).

Spoiler alert: my recap of _this_ talk is going to be "choose who to help, talk about their pain, and help them solve it."

<!-- # Why should you care?

You might feel like this doesn't matter.

You already have a killer idea for the next big web app - maybe you've already built it - and you're just here to learn the tricks to make a bunch of money from it. Like how Adam Wathan made $115k in three days from a $245 PDF file, or how Jordan Gal turned $5k in facebook ads into $348k _additional_ yearly recurring revenue (87x return).

Here's the one weird trick to how they did that: they choose a specific group of people to help, they talked with them about their pain, and they helped them solve it. Incidentally, in exchange for money.

Let's dig into that. -->

# 1. Choose who to help

Start building a business by choosing the people you're helping, not building a thing.

This is counterintuitive. Most of us in this room are some type of engineer - we really like _makin' stuff_. _ruby joke_

You're building a business, not a charity, so you should choose people to help that:

1. **have money** (not homeless snowboard bums),
2. that you **can reach** (so don't pick "real estate agents" if you don't know any real estate agents and have never interacted with one and aren't fully sure they exist - maybe houses are just delivered by house gooses? - it helps to pick a group of people you're already a part of),
3. are people **you want to help**.

That last point is often overlooked, but it's very important. To run and grow a successful business, you're going to be interacting with people like this all the time. If the prospect of interacting with dentists every day for the rest of your life with their tight latex gloves and their sharp pointy metal sticks spookes you deep in your bones, don't pick dentists!

<!-- Adam Wathan chose a great group of people to help: Laravel developers. Laravel developers have money, Adam knows how to reach them because they all hang out on twitter, and he loves interacting with them (he's a Laravel dev himself). Because he chose a great audience, he was able to  $115k in three days from a $245 PDF file.  -->

# 2. Talk about their pain

You might be thinking to yourself, "talking to people? that sounds crushingly terrifying!" And you're right. It is. But here's how you're gonna do it:

Invite them to a quick call to interview them about the work they do. People love talking about themselves - how cool would it be if somebody emailed you asking to hear all about you?

Don't be afraid to follow up. No really - you can follow up _seven times_ and it's not weird. People who are making money are probably really busy making that money and they appreciate the reminder.

If you can, go physically in person to where they are. It's much easier to communicate in person.

Lastly, **instead of talking _at_ them, listen _to_ them**.

<!-- Like this: "hey, do you like my talk?" -> he said "yes" because it would've been super rude to say "no"! -->

If you ask "do you like my idea and would you buy it", they'll say "yes" because saying "no" would be rude. Instead, ask open ended questions like "can you tell me about the types of things you buy", "can you tell me about the type of work you do," "what's an example of something that really annoys you at work," and follow up on interesting points by saying things like "tell me more about..."

Instead of trying to take notes during the conversation, record it and have it transcribed afterwards. You'll be able to listen better that way.

You'll know you've nailed talking with people about their pain when you stop learning new things in your conversations. (Unless you're super bad at listening and haven't learned _anything_ the entire time.)

# 3. Help them solve their problems

You know who you're helping, you know what their problems are, so you're now in a great position to help them solve their problems.

When you're focused on helping specific people solve real problems, you'll avoid mistakes like spending months building something nobody wants (you know people want it because it solves a pain a bunch of people independently told you they had),

Because you've already done the work of finding people, and you know the precise words they use to explain their problems, it's going to be super easy for you to market. When you're writing a landing page or a facebook ad, just copy the words you have in your conversation transcripts. "Don't you hate it when...[callback to first joke]"

Being focused on solving real problems also saves you from spending too much time on details nobody cares about.

That last point is an important one, because it's really easy to try to make your thing perfect before you help anyone with it. It's probably not helping anyone that the first beta of your auto-scaling SaaS is shipping with complex multi-user permissions, so skip it! If it's not helping someone, don't do it.

It's much better to make something _just good enough_ and ship it. You can always make it better later once you've gotten feedback.

<!-- If we were out for a walk and I tripped and fell into the Belagio fountain, I'd hope you wouldn't spend two hours comparing product reviews to find the perfect Amazon pool ladder. I like to think you'd start helping me as quickly as you could. -->

<!-- - cheat sheet guides, lists, short PDF guides, email courses, and ebooks are all great and easy ways to help -->

<!-- The bar for businesses in the economy is just above making something so bad you get sued. -->

<!-- "This is what I do" is more valuable than a perfect product. -->

<!-- - be helpful on the internet -->
<!-- - launch something small, then evaluate how well you did and do it again (Justin Jackson) -->

# Final Thoughts

I got into this because I really like building software. The more I've learned from the Microconf community, the more I've realized that it's not about the software - it's about helping people.

You can get sick of working on a particular product, but if you fall in love with the process of helping people you'll lay the foundation for building a great business.

I promised I'd show you this URL again - microconf.gen.co - I've got all the recaps from last year's talks on there _and_ the talks from this year. Visit that URL and sign up to get a free PDF copy of all the recaps, and please shoot me a quick email letting me know what you're working on and any particular pain you're feeling in building your business, because I'd love to help you ;)

<!-- - Doing this recap, I realized how little information I was retaining from the talks. The hallway track is amazing, but getting 10x more information from the talks made that the best part of last microconf for me. -->

<!-- - building a startup is grinding. Build systems so your daily routine will get you where you want to go.
- Don't look at building a business as a quick way to make money, look at it as a big part of your life for several years.
- What you do over your first 60 days is important, but not nearly as important as what you do consistently over a 40 year career. You can do one big thing every day/week, and two smaller things. One of those smaller things needs to be talking to customers. Don't expect to get dessert done (or push it to the weekend) (patio11)
