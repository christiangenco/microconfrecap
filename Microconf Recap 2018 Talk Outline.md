Last year, I took the official recap notes for every talk in Microconf Starter. This talk is a recap of the main themes I saw coming up over and over in that recap. If you like what you hear in the next 12 minutes, check out my full recaps on every talk from last year at microconf.gen.co (I'll show you that url again at the end).

My recap of _this_ talk is: choose who to help, talk about their pain, and help them solve it.

# Why should you care?

You might feel like this doesn't matter. You already have a killer idea for the next big web app - maybe you've already built it - and you're just here to learn the tricks to make a bunch of money from it. Like how Adam Wathan made $115k in three days from a $245 PDF file, or how Jordan Gal turned $5k in facebook ads into $348k _additional_ yearly recurring revenue (87x return).

Here's the one weird trick to how they did that: they choose a specific group of people to help, they talked with them about their pain, and they helped them solve it. Incidentally, in exchange for money.

Let's dig into that.

# 1. Choose who to help

Start building a business by choosing the people you're helping, not the thing you're building.

This is counterintuitive. Most of us in this room are some type of engineer - we really like _things_.

Because you're building a business, it helps if you choose a group of people 1) **with money** (not homeless snowboard bums), 2) that you **can reach** (so don't pick "real estate agents" if you don't know any real estate agents and have never interacted with one and aren't fully sure they exist - maybe houses are just delivered by house gooses? - it helps to pick a group of people you're already a part of), and 3) are people **you want to help**.

That last point is often overlooked, but it's very important. To run and grow a successful business, you're going to be interacting with people like this all the time. If the prospect of interacting with dentists every day for the rest of your life with their tight latex gloves and their sharp pointy metal sticks spookes you deep in your bones, don't pick them.

Adam Wathan chose a great group of people to help. Laravel developers have money, Adam knows how to reach them because they all hang out on twitter, and he loves interacting with them (he's a Laravel dev himself).

That was point #1: choose who to help.

# 2. Talk about their pain

You might be thinking to yourself, "talking to people? that sounds crushingly terrifying!" And you're right. It is. But here's how you're gonna do it:

First, **find people to talk to**.

You might already have an audience (maybe because you accidentally already built a thing) reach out to your existing users. If you're being a good boi and you haven't built the thing yet and have only just chosen your audience, then reach out to members of that audience! One of the prerequisites of choosing who to help was that you had a way to contact them.

Next, **make it easy for them to talk to you**.

If you're reaching out via. email, limit yourself to asking them to do a single simple thing. "Schedule a call with me" with a link to your calendly works well.

Don't be afraid to follow up seven times - people with money are very busy making more money. Don't put the burdon of remembering to schedule a call with you on them if they miss it the first few times. People love talking about themselves.

If you can, go physically in person to where they are. It's much easier to communicate in person.

Lastly, **instead of talking _at_ them, listen _to_ them**.

<!-- Like this: "hey, do you like my talk?" -> he said "yes" because it would've been super rude to say "no"! -->

If you ask "do you like my idea and would you buy it", they'll say "yes" because saying "no" would be rude. Instead, ask open ended questions like "can you tell me about the types of things you buy", "can you tell me about the type of work you do," "what's an example of something that really annoys you at work," and follow up on interesting points by saying things like "tell me more about..."

Instead of trying to take notes during the conversation, record it and have it transcribed afterwards. You'll be able to listen better that way.

You'll know you've nailed talking with people about their pain when you stop learning new things in your conversations. (Unless you're super bad at listening and haven't learned _anything_ the entire time.)

# 3. Help them solve it

You know who you're helping, you know what their problems are, so you're now in a great position to help them fix their problems.

When you're focused on helping people, you'll avoid mistakes like spending months building something nobody wants (you know people want it because it solves a pain a bunch of people independently told you they had), not knowing how to market (you've already done the work of finding people), and spending too much time on details nobody cares about.

That last point is an important one, because it's really easy to try to make your thing perfect before you help anyone with it. It's much better to make something _just good enough_ and ship it, then iterate quickly on feedback. Why? Because that helps people faster.

- built in secret with extravagant features like complex multi-user permissions
- they spent so much time building Doki in secret that they were afraid to tell people about it, because that would mean they could fail.
- cheat sheet guides, lists, short PDF guides, email courses, and ebooks are all great and easy ways to help

<!-- If someone was drowning in a well, you'd probably yell down to them to stay calm and try floating on their back, then you'd try throwing down some floaty wings so they could stay afloat, then you might get a bunch of bedsheets and try knotting them together to pull them out. You wouldn't start by spending four hours on Amazon comparing the product reviews for the perfect automated rescue harness. -->

<!-- The bar for businesses in the economy is just above making something so bad you get sued. -->

<!-- "This is what I do" is more valuable than a perfect product. -->

- launch something small, then evaluate how well you did and do it again (Justin Jackson)

# Recap

- Doing this recap, I realized how little information I was retaining from the talks. The hallway track is amazing, but getting 10x more information from the talks made that the best part of last microconf for me.
- I got into this because I really like building softare. Technical skills of being able to build software are great, and the least important part of building a business
- building a startup is grinding. Build systems so your daily routine will get you where you want to go.
- Don't look at building a business as a quick way to make money, look at it as a big part of your life for several years.
- What you do over your first 60 days is important, but not nearly as important as what you do consistently over a 40 year career. You can do one big thing every day/week, and two smaller things. One of those smaller things needs to be talking to customers. Don't expect to get dessert done (or push it to the weekend) (patio11)
