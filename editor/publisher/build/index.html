<blockquote>
  <p>Onboarding is really helping people get started and being successful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may wonder: “Is it crazy to worry about onboarding now?”</p>
<p><em>“Is it misguided to think about showing new users a product before you’ve built it?”</em></p>
<p>_“How can you even do onboarding before you have something to onboard someone onto?” _</p>
<p><em>“Uh…what’s onboarding?”</em></p>
<p>No! It will give you a huge advantage, and you should start now.</p>
<p>We'll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The forces that stop people from becoming customers</li>
<li>The information you need to design onboarding sequences</li>
<li>How to turn that information into messages to help people overcome the forces stopping them from becoming a customer</li>
</ul>
<p>Onboarding touches a little on copywriting, user research, and customer success.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People don't want software, they want their problems solved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yu0taji.png" alt="Don't actively make it more difficult for people to get started and solve their problems" /></p>
<p>This mountain is scary and hard because of a lot of <strong>hidden work</strong>. The “Hidden Work” in your SaaS trial includes things like….</p>
<ul>
<li>Forcing your users to figure out what to do first</li>
<li>Forcing your users to watch a 22 minute video before they can even get started</li>
<li>Forcing your users to become an expert on your product before they even know if they like it</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="productcentricwork">Product-Centric Work</h2>
<p>Product-Centric Work (aka, the work of figuring out how to use a new product)</p>
<p>Here are 3 examples of emails you may have gotten in your inbox.</p>
<h3 id="1thevacationphotosapproach">1. The Vacation Photos Approach</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dXzABJ9.png" alt="The Vacation Photos Approach sucks. Watching people's vacation photos is terrible." /></p>
<p>Your user just wants to do something simple - like importing their data. Don't make an onboarding experience. That makes it a lot harder to get started. Don't make your users watch your vacation videos before they can eat the deviled eggs.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Don't make your users watch your vacation videos before they can eat the deviled eggs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2thetoomuchtoosoonapproach">2. The “Too Much Too Soon” Approach</h3>
<p>Don't give people too many options. It doesn't increase the likelihood they'll take action on it.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6EZTmIk.png" alt="Each blue line is a call to action. Overwhelming!" /></p>
<h3 id="3thebadinternapproach">3. The “Bad Intern” Approach</h3>
<p>Don't make your users figure out what they need.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qlq6fz3.png" alt="The Bad Intern approach to onboarding - bleh" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eUYfuCI.png" alt="Don't give your users homework - help them solve their problems" /></p>
<p>People are signing up because they have a problem they want to solve. If you make it hard, only the most committed will get through your bad onboarding.</p>
<h3 id="abetterapproach">A Better Approach</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>No one wants software. Everyone wants their problems solved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5tfdgaK.png" alt="Create a Project! Yes, that's what I want to do. Great onboarding." /></p>
<p>What information do you need to build onboarding email sequences?</p>
<p>It doesn't have to look like a scary email sequence. Think about it as a series of emails that each want your user to do an action.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SG8tHN2.png" alt="28 emails are much simpler if you think of them as a series of actions that get your users to solve a problem" /></p>
<h2 id="internalwork">Internal Work</h2>
<p>Internal Work: aka, the work of forcing yourself to do the thing you think you might want to do</p>
<p>What’s the “job” that your customer hires you to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s going on in their world that made someone consider your product?</li>
<li>What outcome are they looking for?</li>
<li>What do they believe about their problem?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is effectively the <a href="https://microconf.gen.co/claire-suellentrop">Jobs to be Done</a> framework.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your customer’s biggest problem is unlikely to be that they want to try your features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your customer may hate software, but still have the pain your software solves.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M248mR7.png" alt="How to set up a Very Basic Onboarding Automation for a brand new product" /></p>
<p>Asking your cusomters "hey, what's going on in your world?" is a <strong>gold mine</strong> of data.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bmyCSs6.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you're doing this customer research, look for outcome phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>“so that”</li>
<li>“because”</li>
<li>“I want to”</li>
<li>“that way”</li>
<li>“so I can”</li>
<li>“I’ll be able to”</li>
<li>“what I want to do is”</li>
</ul>
<p>Where do you put this research? Try:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.airstory.co/">Airstory</a>: free tool for clipping, organizing, and writing with voice of customer data</li>
<li><a href="https://nomnominsights.com/">Nomnom</a>: aggregate customer feedback on an existing project</li>
<li><a href="https://usabilityhub.com/">Usability-Hub</a>: get feedback on usability</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't just <em>pretend</em> to go through UX research ("UX theatre"). Ex: find a random quote and try to pass it off as a customer quote.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/spydergrrl/status/955218540977631232</p>
<p>If your product isn't based in user feedback, you have a huge cultural problem.</p>
<h2 id="howdoyouwriteemails">How do you write emails?</h2>
<p>What should an onboarding email do? Get your customers to come back. Everyone is always leaving.</p>
<p>How? Three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Message-Matching: Get them to overcome their internal hurdles.</li>
<li>Instructions: eliminate the product-centric work involved with doing what you're asking them to do</li>
<li>Call to action: invite them to complete the action they need to take now.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6uHBS6z.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>BananaBlaster fictional example:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GhE0lG5.png" alt="BananaBlaster helps you keep track of your bananas" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/02PzMyr.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/l87JoQf.png" alt="Exact Phrase Message Matching in action on BananaBlaster" /></p>
<p>Don't make people watch a 35 minute video, just tell them how to solve their problems.</p>
<p>You should also pay attention to how your customer is going to be using this information. Are they going to be on the subway and can't load your links?</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mkgbkXj.jpg" alt="Testing is Dead. Long Live Testing. You guys got that this is like &quot;The Queen is Dead Long Live the Queen&quot; right?" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ozMUGha.png" alt=" Joining the conversation happening in your reader’s head works." /></p>
<p>You can say "there are 35 ways to use this project" but it doesn't work as well as joining the conversation happening in your reader's head and solving the problem they're having <em>right now</em>.</p>
<p>Making it easy to get started works. Harvest's "Create a Project" email hasn't changed in years.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4O0sH20.png" alt="Talking to people like they are real people works." /></p>

<h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
<p>To help your customers get started, get the right mindset:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re teaching people something new</li>
<li>You’re solving their problems</li>
<li>You’re eliminating hidden work</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Do you start off users with the first email in each action?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, then drill down.</p>
<p><strong>In your examples of emails, they're all plaintext. We've noticed those do a lot better (because people are sick of the Mailchimp template). Our current onboarding series can't be plaintext because they have screenshots.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, start with plaintext. Also test what works best for you.</p>
<p><strong>You touched on the "what's up in your world" research emails and the "here's our product" call to action emails. Are those separate? In the same email?</strong></p>
<p>Do it separately. Keep people tightly focused on a single action.</p>
<p><strong>How do you consider in-app onboarding?</strong></p>
<p>You want both in-app and email onboarding. Email onboarding is for when they leave.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of onboarding in-app happens right when you sign up, but often people sign up at 2am when they're not ready to actually onboard.</p></body></html>
