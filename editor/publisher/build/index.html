It felt like a huge burden lifted from me.</p><footer class="blockquote-footer">Adam Wathan<!-- -->, Microconf 2018<!-- --> </footer></blockquote><p>Adam has experimented with pre-selling on his info-products.</p><p>ADVANTAGES:</p><ul><li>Best form of <strong>product validation</strong>. If someone gives you money before you&#x27;ve created it, that&#x27;s great proof that they&#x27;re actually interested.</li><li>You&#x27;ll <strong>make more money</strong>. You&#x27;ll have more opportunity to promote it by telling people about updates without seeming spammy (&quot;buy this! buy this! buy this!&quot;)</li><li>More <strong>motivation to finish</strong>. If you already have people&#x27;s money, you&#x27;ll push through burnout. You don&#x27;t want to not deliver on something people have already paid you for.</li><li>Can <strong>buy you the time to focus on the product</strong>. If you have a successful pre-launch, you can afford to do less freelance work to buy more of your time.</li></ul><p>DISADVANTAGES</p><ul><li>Selling <strong>multiple tiers is trickier</strong>. It&#x27;s harder to get people to buy the more expensive packages if right now they all get the same thing.</li><li>Can&#x27;t easily <strong>change scope</strong>. Cutting scope is a great way to make your goal more attainable, but if you presell and promised too much you can end up in a situation where it takes you way longer to finish, which is a beat-down.</li><li>Like <strong>taking on debt</strong>, can be extremely stressful. Mechanically, pre-orders make you more money. Psychologically, it can be really stressful.</li></ul><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&quot;Holy fuck I gotta finish this thing people are gonna be so fucking angry.&quot; - maybe don&#x27;t presell</p><footer class="blockquote-footer">Adam Wathan<!-- -->, Microconf 2018<!-- --> </footer></blockquote><h2>BUILDING YOUR EMAIL LIST</h2><h3>STEP #1: TELL YOUR AUDIENCE</h3><p>Announce that you&#x27;re going to announce your announcement before you announce it:</p><p><img src="http://localhost:3002/978661856687484928.png" alt=""/></p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Announce that you&#x27;re going to announce your announcement before you announce it</p><footer class="blockquote-footer">Adam Wathan<!-- -->, Microconf 2018<!-- --> </footer></blockquote><p>You usually get your biggest spike in signups at launch. How can you sustain it?</p><h3>STEP #2 SHARE UPDATES</h3><p>Keep your list engaged and excited about the product by sharing updates:</p><p><img src="http://localhost:3002/988443466890854402.png" alt=""/></p><p>If you don&#x27;t have anything free to send out, just send out a work update:</p><p><img src="http://localhost:3002/987362810521792512.png" alt=""/></p><h3>STEP #3 REPURPOSE CONTENT</h3><p>If you&#x27;re working on this full time, it can be hard to also be generating content to hype it up.</p><p>Try just repurposing your main content into a massaged blog post:</p><p><div class="card mb-3"><img src="http://localhost:3001/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F5YaplDi.png" alt="Repurpose content you already have" class="card-img-top"/><div class="card-body"><p class="card-text">Repurpose content you already have</p></div></div></p><h2>Getting it Finished</h2><h3>STRATEGY #1: MAKE PROMISES</h3><p>Making promises to your audience can keep you on track:</p><p><img src="http://localhost:3002/982749280849940480.png" alt=""/></p><h3>STRATEGY #2: EMAIL ON A SCHEDULE</h3><p>For Adam&#x27;s audience, emailing once a week is pretty good so they don&#x27;t forget about what he&#x27;s working on and stay excited.

You still have more emails to send. You&#x27;ll start getting feedback, and you need to start cataloging it.</p><p><img src="http://localhost:3002/733273064201392128.png" alt=""/></p><p>Send an email to everyone that hasn&#x27;t bought it yet with this early feedback and a bunch more people will buy it.</p><p>Don&#x27;t be afraid of giving out free content!
