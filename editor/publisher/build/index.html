He got the idea to build it, spent months and months developing it, then one day tweeted it out and expected to get rich.</p><p>That launch was in November of 2015. Since launching, it&#x27;s only made $3,650 in sales from 19 customers.</p><p>Working a full time job, Adam didn&#x27;t have the resources to grow Nitpick started looking for another way to make a living with an online product.</p><p>The next thing he tried was launching an infoproduct - Refactoring to Collections (launched in May 2016).</p><p>In the first three days it made $61k - about 17x what Nitpick has ever made - so Adam quit his job.</p><p><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FrBf7Rhd.png"/><figcaption>Refactoring to Collections&#x27; launch sales</figcaption></figure></p><p>His next product was <span><a href="https://course.testdrivenlaravel.com/">Test Driven Laravel</a><span class="foot">https://course.testdrivenlaravel.com/</span></span>, which made $116k in its first three days of launching.</p><p><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F0vNvKhC.png"/><figcaption>Adam&#x27;s sales in just his first two years of info-product business</figcaption></figure></p><h1>Info Products</h1><p><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FIvrS4Iq.jpg"/><figcaption>Rob Walling hadoukens his Stair Step approach - a great model for starting with an info-product</figcaption></figure></p><h2>Why an Info-Product?</h2><ul><li>One-time purchase products are way easier to sell. Don&#x27;t we all have a course saved on our laptop that we bought and never actually watched? The person who made that course has your $20, but the $4 re-occurring charge for a service that you canceled when you didn&#x27;t use it one month isn&#x27;t getting your money anymore.</li><li>They can be &quot;done,&quot; i.e. you don&#x27;t have to maintain them forever.</li><li>You can put one together in 3 months of nights and weekends.</li><li>They put money in the bank fast, then drop off, which is the opposite of SaaS. That fast money up front can be used to bankroll your time so you can invest in other things, like that Saas business you&#x27;ve always wanted to make!</li></ul><p>Don&#x27;t just take Adam&#x27;s word for it; other experts in the field agree!</p><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><img src="http://localhost:4001/982326554414985216.png" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/brennandunn/status/982326554414985216">https://twitter.com/brennandunn/status/982326554414985216</a></figcaption></figure></p><h1>Getting Started on Your Info-Product</h1><h2>Build an Audience</h2><h3>Why?</h3><ul><li>You can&#x27;t just throw up a landing page and expect people to sign up; people need to trust you and believe that you&#x27;re the right person to help them.</li><li>Having a large audience can make up for any other deficiency in your marketing plan. A huge audience and a terrible strategy beats a perfect marketing strategy and no audience.</li></ul><h3>How?</h3><ul><li>Be helpful on the Internet!!! This means blog posts, tutorials, screencasts, podcasts, interviews, anything that makes you worth following.</li></ul><p>Here&#x27;s a specific strategy that works well for Adam, which he stole from @wesbos.</p><aside>Help people where they already are @wesbos</aside><p>Where are people? Well, a lot of them are on Twitter! Here&#x27;s a useful tip that Wes Bos condensed into a single tweet.</p><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><img src="http://localhost:4001/984500364245389312.png" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/984500364245389312?lang=en">https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/984500364245389312?lang=en</a></figcaption></figure></p><p>Notice that tweet isn&#x27;t a link to a blog post that&#x27;s helpful, it&#x27;s a small piece of help in of itself, which is why it has so many retweets and likes.</p><p>Adam does the same thing as Wes Bos, but with his own audience, through tweets like this:</p><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><img src="http://localhost:4001/829423543985307661.png" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/829423543985307661?lang=en">https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/829423543985307661?lang=en</a></figcaption></figure></p><p>You can do the same sort of thing, even if you don&#x27;t already have an audience! Here&#x27;s how Steve Schoger, a guy with no audience to start with, did it:</p><p>In Setember 2016 <span><a href="https://twitter.com/steveschoger">steveschoger</a><span class="foot">https://twitter.com/steveschoger</span></span> had 436 twitter followers. He was just doing typical social media updates, which no one cares about.</p><p><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fc9CAktU.jpg"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>But he wanted to grow his audience, so he started doing helpful tweets about his area of expertise: design. And boom! Way higher engagement on helpful tweets from Steve!</p><p>In less that a year and a half, after posting more helpful tweets and helping people where they are, he&#x27;s jumped to over 20k followers:</p><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><img src="http://localhost:4001/981606881255976961.png" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/981606881255976961">https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/981606881255976961</a></figcaption></figure></p><p>You can do that too. Just help people where they already are. For developers, that&#x27;s probably Twitter.</p><h1>Picking the Right Idea</h1><h2>Step 1: Have an Idea</h2><ul><li>What are you already putting out there that people seem excited about?</li><li>What are you excited about that you think others will get excited about? What do you think you are ahead of the curve on?</li><li>What do people think you&#x27;re better than them at? What sorts of questions are people asking you? If people think you&#x27;re better than them at something, that&#x27;s an opportunity to teach.</li><li>What have you learned outside your community/watering hole that you think your community would benefit from? That&#x27;s right, you don&#x27;t have to invent these ideas yourself, you can just re-package things that already exist! Essentially:</li></ul><aside>You could be the Christopher Columbus of programming knowledge.</aside><ul><li>What did you have to figure out yourself that was really helpful to learn? You could make that easier for other people!</li></ul><h2>Step 2: Test It</h2><p>Some people would tell you to throw up a landing page first thing and try to get people&#x27;s emails to see if people are interested in your idea. But Adam thinks you should do these things first:</p><ul><li>Tests ideas with small tweets (or message board posts, or whatever else you use to communicate with your people):</li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><img src="http://localhost:4001/956620857236959232.png" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/956620857236959232">https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/956620857236959232</a></figcaption></figure></p><ul><li>If it looks like things are working in a small format, move on to a longer form, like a high quality, long-form, comprehensive blog post:</li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><img src="http://localhost:4001/976909385938059264.png" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/976909385938059264">https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/976909385938059264</a></figcaption></figure></p><ul><li>Catalog any good feedback you get about this test content, like replies on Twitter, blog post comments, etc. It&#x27;ll be useful very soon!</li></ul><h2>Step 3: Define the Product</h2><ul><li>Start by planning small, because the product will end up bigger than you think. <!-- -->*<!-- --> Planning small will also help you be concise: a short book is still a book, and a 3 hour video course can totally be sufficient.</li><li>Books are a lot easier to work on than things that require recording, like courses, especially if you only have short blocks of time.</li><li>Courses are easier to sell at a higher price than books, but a lot harder to produce on nights and weekends.</li></ul><h1>Putting up a Landing Page</h1><p>The landing page collects your email addresses, and confirms that people are interested in this topic as a product, not just a tweet.</p><ul><li>Start with a clear headline that explains what users will learn from your product. For Adam&#x27;s <span><a href="https://adamwathan.me/advanced-vue-component-design/">Advanced Vue Component Design&#x27;s landing page,</a><span class="foot">https://adamwathan.me/advanced-vue-component-design/</span></span> that headline is: &quot;Learn how to design simpler, more flexible components that are both more powerful and easier to maintain.&quot;</li></ul><p><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FYVfPkj5.jpg"/><figcaption>Advanced Vue Component Design&#x27;s Landing Page</figcaption></figure></p><ul><li><p>Next, give people a clear incentive to sign up for your email list - not just &quot;sign up if you&#x27;re interested!&quot; Give them a reason to give you their email address! Promise them some free content. In the example above the incentive is clear: &quot;Sign up for <strong>free screencasts</strong> and a <strong>big discount</strong> when the course is released this May.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Be sure to give people some evidence that proves you know what you&#x27;re talking about. On Adam&#x27;s landing page the link to <span><a href="https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/">Renderless Components in Vue.js</a><span class="foot">https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/</span></span> proves Adam is an expert.</p></li><li>Throw in pieces of social proof that you know your stuff, like the user testimonial above. This doesn&#x27;t have to be a review from an influencer, it just has to serve the same purpose as an Amazon review.</li></ul><p><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FHhvcBAi.png"/><figcaption>The link to Adam&#x27;s previous work, Renderless Components in Vue.js, and the review from a fan help convince landing-page-viewers that they should give Adam their email.</figcaption></figure></p><ul><li><p>Then, outline what you&#x27;re planning to do with your product. Keep it simple.</p></li><li><p>At the end of the page drop another sign up form, with a little bit more social proof if you have any. This is for those people who needed to read your whole page to be convinced to give you their email.</p></li><li>Finally, finish up your page with a little &quot;Who Am I?&quot; section. Link to Twitter, any other products you&#x27;ve already released, or even just cool things you&#x27;ve made or done, like your blog, conference talks, etc. This is another way to convince someone that you can be trusted to know what you&#x27;re talking about.</li></ul><h1>Side Note: Should You Pre-Sell?</h1><p>Adam has done it both ways: he completely finished and then released his first product, and released his second product in early access when he was done with 20%, then added new content as he went on.</p><h2>Advantages:</h2><ul><li>Pre-sales are the best form of product validation. If someone gives you money before you&#x27;ve created it, that&#x27;s great proof that they&#x27;re actually interested.</li><li>You&#x27;ll make more money. You&#x27;ll have more opportunity to promote the product by telling people about product updates, without seeming spammy with &quot;buy this! buy this! buy this!&quot; emails.</li><li>You might have more motivation to finish. If you already have people&#x27;s money, you&#x27;ll push through burnout. You don&#x27;t want to not deliver on something people have already paid you for.</li><li>Pre-sales can buy you the time to focus on the product. If you have a successful pre-launch, you can afford to do less freelance work to buy more of your time for this product.</li></ul><h2>Disadvantages</h2><ul><li>Selling multiple tiers is trickier. It&#x27;s harder to get people to buy the more expensive packages if right now all users get the same thing from your product (because the fancy add-ons aren&#x27;t ready yet).</li><li>You can&#x27;t easily change scope. Cutting scope is a great way to make your goal more attainable, but if you pre-sell and promise too much, then you can end up in a situation where it takes you way longer to finish, which is a beat-down.</li><li>Like taking on debt, pre-selling can be extremely stressful. Mechanically, pre-sales make you more money. Psychologically, they can be really stressful. You might find yourself thinking this when pre-sale orders come in:</li></ul><aside>&quot;Holy fuck I gotta finish this thing people are gonna be so fucking angry.&quot;</aside><h1>Building Your Email List</h1><h2>Step #1: Tell Your Audience</h2><ul><li>Announce that you&#x27;re going to announce your landing page before you announce it: <!-- -->*<!-- --> A tweet like the one below won&#x27;t get much engagement, but it will prime your audience to share your real announcement.</li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><img src="http://localhost:4001/978661856687484928.png" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/978661856687484928">https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/978661856687484928</a></figcaption></figure></p><ul><li>Then, announce to your existing audience.</li></ul><p>You usually get your biggest spike in sign-ups at launch. How can you sustain that, you might be wondering? Well...</p><h2>Step #2: Share Progress</h2><ul><li>Keep your list engaged and excited about the product by sharing updates, especially updates with a bit of free content.</li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><img src="http://localhost:4001/988443466890854402.png" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/988443466890854402">https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/988443466890854402</a></figcaption></figure></p><ul><li>If you don&#x27;t have anything free to send out, just send out a behind-the-scenes work update:</li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><img src="http://localhost:4001/987362810521792512.png" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/987362810521792512">https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/987362810521792512</a></figcaption></figure></p><ul><li>Don&#x27;t just share these updates with people who have already signed up. Put updates on Twitter too, to encourage new people to sign up.</li></ul><h2>Step #3: Re-purpose Content</h2><p>If you&#x27;re working on this project part-time, then it can be hard to also be generating content to market your product.</p><ul><li>Try just re-purposing your main content into a stand-alone blog post.</li></ul><p><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F5YaplDi.png"/><figcaption>Re-purposing the content you already have can be insanely valuable</figcaption></figure></p><ul><li>Be sure to mention that your re-purposed content is from a product that you&#x27;re currently making, and throw in a call to action for sign-ups.</li></ul><h1>Getting It Finished</h1><h2>Strategy #1: Make Public Promises</h2><p>Promising things to people on public platforms can make you feel accountable and motivated to deliver.</p><h2>Strategy #2: Email on a Schedule</h2><p>For Adam&#x27;s audience, emailing once a week makes sure people stay excited, and don&#x27;t forget about what he&#x27;s working on. Having an email schedule like that can help you feel like people are expecting content from you.</p><aside>I&#x27;m afraid to go a week without emailing people.</aside><h2>Strategy #3: Reduce Scope</h2><p>If you find you&#x27;ve been working on your product for 6 months, but there&#x27;s no end in sight, and you already have something substantial, then just move the finish line closer by reducing the scope of your project.</p><h1>Figuring Out Pricing</h1><h2>Topic #1: Tiered Pricing</h2><h3>Single Tier/No Tier Pricing</h3><ul><li>Can be fine if you can charge enough for your one tier.</li><li>Often necessary if you&#x27;re pre-selling.</li><li>Nice if you can&#x27;t figure out a way to add additional tiers that actually feel valuable.</li></ul><p>In general though, prefer multiple tiers.</p><h3>Two Tier Pricing</h3><p>Use price anchoring: make the second tier your real product, with the first tier as a reduced version of your product that really only exists to push people to the second tier.</p><p><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F8jjKhqg.jpg"/><figcaption>@wesbos&#x27;s second tier is only $10 more, but it has twice as much content, displaying the price anchoring strategy.</figcaption></figure></p><ul><li>The first tier makes second tier look like a better deal, since the prices are close.</li><li>This works well with video courses, where it&#x27;s easy to cut content for the budget version.</li></ul><h3>Three Tier Pricing</h3><ul><li>Great for books if you can come up with the bonus content.</li><li>Makes it easier for users to evaluate your product on its own instead of comparing it to Amazon book or something else.</li><li>Prices are usually 1x, ~2x, ~5x.</li><li>This will make you a lot more money from a book than just selling the book on its own.</li></ul><p><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FXdTnSaI.png"/><figcaption>Even though the top tier of Adam&#x27;s book Refactoring to Collections only sold 220 copies, it made the most money thanks to bonus content that wasn&#x27;t even as valuable as the book.</figcaption></figure></p><h2>Topic #2: Launch Discounts</h2><ul><li>Discount it by enough to be appealing, at least 30%.</li><li>Use stepped discounts. Lower discount on cheaper tiers and better discount on higher tiers will push people up to the better tiers.</li><li>Reverse engineer the non-discounted price from your planned discounted price. That means don&#x27;t discount the price you want to charge! Pick the price that you want to charge, make that the &quot;discounted&quot; price, and make the &quot;un-discounted&quot; price your preferred price plus whatever you&#x27;re taking off with the discount.</li></ul><h1>Nailing the Launch</h1><p>This is actually the easy part of the whole thing!</p><h2>Step #1: Build the Sales Page</h2><ul><li>Still include an email sign up! A lot of people are tire-kickers who are just on your page to see free content. Once you have their email though, you can try to sell them stuff.</li><li>Use testimonials and social proof. You can use feedback from preview content to start off.</li><li>Sort tiers from highest price to lowest price, and make sure your visuals communicate that your highest tier is the biggest, real product that people should want.</li></ul><h3>Step #2: Announce the Launch Details</h3><ul><li>Send out an email saying: I got it done. Include all package and pricing details, as well as the launch date.</li><li>If you can, send out some final free content.</li></ul><h3>Step #3: Launch It</h3><p>The easiest and most fun part!</p><ul><li>Send out a simple email: &quot;It&#x27;s available, all the info is here at the website.&quot;</li><li>Leverage your time zones if you need to. Adam uses morning Eastern Time Zone to launch things because he has a lot of European customers.</li><li>Pick you favorite day:</li></ul><aside>I like Tuesdays. I have no evidence, but it seems like a good day to launch things. Monday is too early, every other day seems too late. Tuesday seems fine.</aside><ul><li>Sit back and make money!</li></ul><h3>Step #4: Leverage Early Feedback</h3><p>You&#x27;re not done! You still have more emails to send.</p><ul><li>Catalog feedback from the first people who buy your product, including tweets like this one.</li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><img src="http://localhost:4001/733273064201392128.png" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/philwinkle/status/733273064201392128">https://twitter.com/philwinkle/status/733273064201392128</a></figcaption></figure></p><ul><li><p>A couple days later send an email to everyone that hasn&#x27;t bought your product yet with this early feedback, and a bunch more people will buy it!</p></li><li>Send another free preview if you can. Don&#x27;t be afraid of giving out free content! Adam has given out about 60% of his content for free.</li></ul><h3>Step #5: Closing the Launch</h3><p><strong>Controversial Advice:</strong> Don&#x27;t specify a closing date in advance.</p><ul><li>Having a specified launch closing date can make you feel obligated to shut down a launch discount that is making you tons of money. Adam has done that. It sucked.</li></ul><aside>I had a money hose that was just like firing money at me, and I was just like &quot;Oh, we gotta get this under control! We gotta turn this off! I don&#x27;t want this money!&quot;</aside><ul><li><p>Tell people that during the launch there will be a discount, and read the field of your sales to see when sales are dropping off. That&#x27;s the signal for the end of your launch.</p></li><li>Then, email people to tell them the launch is ending in a week. That will drive more sales, like a smaller, second launch week.</li></ul><h1>Adam Wathan&#x27;s Recommended Microconf Resources</h1><p>Source: <span><a href="https://gist.github.com/adamwathan/30dc4230ac575cfa3425b39ca11ea859">Adam&#x27;s Github Info Link</a><span class="foot">https://gist.github.com/adamwathan/30dc4230ac575cfa3425b39ca11ea859</span></span></p><h2>Tools for selling your product online</h2><ul><li><span><a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a><span class="foot">https://gumroad.com/</span></span>, what I use, biggest pro is you just get a single deposit each week direct to bank account, no dealing with Stripe/PayPal directly, so much easier for accounting/book-keeping, especially if you live somewhere where you need to worry about collecting sales tax</li><li><span><a href="https://www.podia.com/">Podia</a><span class="foot">https://www.podia.com/</span></span>, bring your own Stripe/PayPal but has a great course editor which Gumroad doesn&#x27;t have</li></ul><h2>Email marketing tools</h2><ul><li><span><a href="http://mbsy.co/convertkit/20592464">ConvertKit</a><span class="foot">http://mbsy.co/convertkit/20592464</span></span>, what I use, no complaints</li><li><span><a href="https://www.drip.com/">Drip</a><span class="foot">https://www.drip.com/</span></span>, also great, would have no reason to switch away if I was using it</li></ul><h2>Sales page examples</h2><ul><li><span><a href="https://adamwathan.me/refactoring-to-collections/">Refactoring to Collections</a><span class="foot">https://adamwathan.me/refactoring-to-collections/</span></span>, my first product</li><li><span><a href="https://course.testdrivenlaravel.com/">Test-Driven Laravel</a><span class="foot">https://course.testdrivenlaravel.com/</span></span>, my second product</li></ul><h2>Coming soon page examples</h2><ul><li><span><a href="https://adamwathan.me/advanced-vue-component-design/">Advanced Vue Component Design</a><span class="foot">https://adamwathan.me/advanced-vue-component-design/</span></span>, my next course</li></ul><h2>Reading material</h2><ul><li><span><a href="https://adamwathan.me/the-book-launch-that-let-me-quit-my-job/">Recap of my Refactoring to Collections launch</a><span class="foot">https://adamwathan.me/the-book-launch-that-let-me-quit-my-job/</span></span>, includes tons of details, full content for every email sent, etc.</li><li><span><a href="http://nathanbarry.com/authority/">&quot;Authority&quot;</a><span class="foot">http://nathanbarry.com/authority/</span></span> book by Nathan Barry (best price here: <span><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/authority">https://gumroad.com/l/authority</a><span class="foot">https://gumroad.com/l/authority</span></span>)</li><li><span><a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/selling-ebook.html">&quot;An eBook pricing model that resulted in $100,000 in sales&quot;</a><span class="foot">https://blog.asmartbear.com/selling-ebook.html</span></span>, blog post on tiered pricing</li></ul><h1>Question</h1><p><strong>It looked like from your charts that you had huge revenue spikes at launch, but also a long tail of revenue on both products. Did you re-prime the pump?</strong></p><p>Those charts are just for the first three days, so that wasn&#x27;t a huge tail.</p><p>When I&#x27;ve released in early access before, it&#x27;s been easy to update people about new content, which gets new people to see and buy the product, especially since it was still at an early access price.</p><p>For my book, sales dropped off very seriously after the launch was over, which is why I feel like I made a big mistake in closing the launch after three days.</p><p>I got around this mistake a little by sending out an email telling people that they could still get the launch discount because I had gotten back feedback that people had just been unable to get to the launch discount in time.</p><p>In general now, I send people free content over 2 weeks after the launch, and if they haven&#x27;t bought the product by then I send them a coupon for a big discount that expires really soon, which encourages people to buy immediately.
