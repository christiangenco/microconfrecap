That fast money up front can be used to bankroll your time so you can invest in other things, like that Saas business you&#x27;ve always wanted to make!</li></ul><p>Don&#x27;t just take Adam&#x27;s word for it; other experts in the field agree!</p><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/brennandunn/status/982326554414985216">https://twitter.com/brennandunn/status/982326554414985216</a></figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3002/982326554414985216.png" alt=""/></figure></p><h1>Getting Started on Your Info-Product</h1><h2>Build an Audience</h2><h3>Why?</h3><ul><li>You can&#x27;t just throw up a landing page and expect people to sign up; people need to trust you and believe that you&#x27;re the right person to help them.</li><li>Having a large audience can make up for any other deficiency in your marketing plan. A huge audience and a terrible strategy beats a perfect marketing strategy and no audience.</li></ul><h3>How?</h3><ul><li>Be helpful on the Internet!!! This means blog posts, tutorials, screencasts, podcasts, interviews, anything that makes you worth following. </li></ul><p>Here&#x27;s a specific strategy that works well for Adam, which he stole from @wesbos.</p><aside>Help people where they already are @wesbos</aside><p>Where are people? Well, a lot of them are on Twitter! Here&#x27;s a useful tip that Wes Bos condensed into a single tweet.</p><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/984500364245389312?lang=en">https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/984500364245389312?lang=en</a></figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3002/984500364245389312.png" alt=""/></figure></p><p>Notice that tweet isn&#x27;t a link to a blog post that&#x27;s helpful, it&#x27;s a small piece of help in of itself, which is why it has so many retweets and likes. </p><p>Adam does the same thing as Wes Bos, but with his own audience, through tweets like this:</p><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/829423543985307661?lang=en">https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/829423543985307661?lang=en</a></figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3002/829423543985307661.png" alt=""/></figure></p><p>You can do the same sort of thing, even if you don&#x27;t already have an audience! Here&#x27;s how Steve Schoger, a guy with no audience to start with, did it:</p><p>In Setember 2016 <span><a href="https://twitter.com/steveschoger">steveschoger</a><span class="foot">https://twitter.com/steveschoger</span></span> had 436 twitter followers. He was just doing typical social media updates, which no one cares about. </p><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption></figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3001/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fc9CAktU.jpg"/></figure></p><p>But he wanted to grow his audience, so he started doing helpful tweets about his area of expertise: design. And boom! Way higher engagement on helpful tweets from Steve!</p><p>In less that a year and a half, after posting more helpful tweets and helping people where they are, he&#x27;s jumped to over 20k followers:</p><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/981606881255976961">https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/981606881255976961</a></figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3002/981606881255976961.png" alt=""/></figure></p><p>You can do that too. Just help people where they already are. For developers, that&#x27;s probably Twitter. </p><h1>Picking the Right Idea</h1><h2>Step 1: Have an Idea</h2><ul><li>What are you already putting out there that people seem excited about?</li><li>What are you excited about that you think others will get excited about? What do you think you are ahead of the curve on?</li><li>What do people think you&#x27;re better than them at? What sorts of questions are people asking you? If people think you&#x27;re better than them at something, that&#x27;s an opportunity to teach.</li><li>What have you learned outside your community/watering hole that you think your community would benefit from? That&#x27;s right, you don&#x27;t have to invent these ideas yourself, you can just re-package things that already exist! Essentially: </li></ul><aside>You could be the Christopher Columbus of programming knowledge.</aside><ul><li>What did you have to figure out yourself that was really helpful to learn? You could make that easier for other people!</li></ul><h2>Step 2: Test It</h2><p>Some people would tell you to throw up a landing page first thing and try to get people&#x27;s emails to see if people are interested in your idea. But Adam thinks you should do these things first:</p><ul><li>Tests ideas with small tweets (or message board posts, or whatever else you use to communicate with your people):</li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/956620857236959232">https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/956620857236959232</a></figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3002/956620857236959232.png" alt=""/></figure></p><ul><li>If it looks like things are working in a small format, move on to a longer form, like a high quality, long-form, comprehensive blog post:</li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/976909385938059264">https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/976909385938059264</a></figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3002/976909385938059264.png" alt=""/></figure></p><ul><li>Catalog any good feedback you get about this test content, like replies on Twitter, blog post comments, etc. It&#x27;ll be useful very soon!</li></ul><h2>Step 3: Define the Product</h2><ul><li>Start by planning small, because the product will end up bigger than you think. 
		* Planning small will also help you be concise: a short book is still a book, and a 3 hour video course can totally be sufficient. </li><li>Books are a lot easier to work on than things that require recording, like courses, especially if you only have short blocks of time. </li><li>Courses are easier to sell at a higher price than books, but a lot harder to produce on nights and weekends.</li></ul><h1>Putting up a Landing Page</h1><p>The landing page collects your email addresses, and confirms that people are interested in this topic as a product, not just a tweet.</p><ul><li>Start with a clear headline that explains what users will learn from your product. For Adam&#x27;s <span><a href="https://adamwathan.me/advanced-vue-component-design/">Advanced Vue Component Design&#x27;s landing page,</a><span class="foot">https://adamwathan.me/advanced-vue-component-design/</span></span> that headline is: &quot;Learn how to design simpler, more flexible components that are both more powerful and easier to maintain.&quot;</li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption>Advanced Vue Component Design&#x27;s Landing Page</figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3001/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FYVfPkj5.jpg"/></figure></p><ul><li><p>Next, give people a clear incentive to sign up for your email list - not just &quot;sign up if you&#x27;re interested!&quot; Give them a reason to give you their email address! Promise them some free content. In the example above the incentive is clear: &quot;Sign up for <strong>free screencasts</strong> and a <strong>big discount</strong> when the course is released this May.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Be sure to give people some evidence that proves you know what you&#x27;re talking about. On Adam&#x27;s landing page the link to <span><a href="https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/">Renderless Components in Vue.js</a><span class="foot">https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/</span></span> proves Adam is an expert.</p></li><li>Throw in pieces of social proof that you know your stuff, like the user testimonial above. This doesn&#x27;t have to be a review from an influencer, it just has to serve the same purpose as an Amazon review. </li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption>The link to Adam&#x27;s previous work, Renderless Components in Vue.js, and the review from a fan help convince landing-page-viewers that they should give Adam their email.</figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3001/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FHhvcBAi.png"/></figure></p><ul><li><p>Then, outline what you&#x27;re planning to do with your product. Keep it simple. </p></li><li><p>At the end of the page drop another sign up form, with a little bit more social proof if you have any. This is for those people who needed to read your whole page to be convinced to give you their email. </p></li><li>Finally, finish up your page with a little &quot;Who Am I?&quot; section. Link to Twitter, any other products you&#x27;ve already released, or even just cool things you&#x27;ve made or done, like your blog, conference talks, etc. This is another way to convince someone that you can be trusted to know what you&#x27;re talking about.</li></ul><h1>Side Note: Should You Pre-Sell?</h1><p>Adam has done it both ways: he completely finished and then released his first product, and released his second product in early access when he was done with 20%, then added new content as he went on. </p><h2>Advantages:</h2><ul><li>Pre-sales are the best form of product validation. If someone gives you money before you&#x27;ve created it, that&#x27;s great proof that they&#x27;re actually interested.</li><li>You&#x27;ll make more money. You&#x27;ll have more opportunity to promote the product by telling people about product updates, without seeming spammy with &quot;buy this! buy this! buy this!&quot; emails.</li><li>You might have more motivation to finish. If you already have people&#x27;s money, you&#x27;ll push through burnout. You don&#x27;t want to not deliver on something people have already paid you for.</li><li>Pre-sales can buy you the time to focus on the product. If you have a successful pre-launch, you can afford to do less freelance work to buy more of your time for this product. </li></ul><h2>Disadvantages</h2><ul><li>Selling multiple tiers is trickier. It&#x27;s harder to get people to buy the more expensive packages if right now all users get the same thing from your product (because the fancy add-ons aren&#x27;t ready yet). </li><li>You can&#x27;t easily change scope. Cutting scope is a great way to make your goal more attainable, but if you pre-sell and promise too much, then you can end up in a situation where it takes you way longer to finish, which is a beat-down.</li><li>Like taking on debt, pre-selling can be extremely stressful. Mechanically, pre-sales make you more money. Psychologically, they can be really stressful. You might find yourself thinking this when pre-sale orders come in:</li></ul><aside>&quot;Holy fuck I gotta finish this thing people are gonna be so fucking angry.&quot;</aside><h1>Building Your Email List</h1><h2>Step #1: Tell Your Audience</h2><ul><li>Announce that you&#x27;re going to announce your landing page before you announce it:
		* A tweet like the one below won&#x27;t get much engagement, but it will prime your audience to share your real announcement. </li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/978661856687484928">https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/978661856687484928</a></figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3002/978661856687484928.png" alt=""/></figure></p><ul><li>Then, announce to your existing audience.</li></ul><p>You usually get your biggest spike in sign-ups at launch. How can you sustain that, you might be wondering? Well...</p><h2>Step #2: Share Progress</h2><ul><li>Keep your list engaged and excited about the product by sharing updates, especially updates with a bit of free content.</li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/988443466890854402">https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/988443466890854402</a></figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3002/988443466890854402.png" alt=""/></figure></p><ul><li>If you don&#x27;t have anything free to send out, just send out a behind-the-scenes work update:</li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/987362810521792512">https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/987362810521792512</a></figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3002/987362810521792512.png" alt=""/></figure></p><ul><li>Don&#x27;t just share these updates with people who have already signed up. Put updates on Twitter too, to encourage new people to sign up.</li></ul><h2>Step #3: Re-purpose Content</h2><p>If you&#x27;re working on this project part-time, then it can be hard to also be generating content to market your product.</p><ul><li>Try just re-purposing your main content into a stand-alone blog post.</li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption>Re-purposing the content you already have can be insanely valuable</figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3001/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F5YaplDi.png"/></figure></p><ul><li>Be sure to mention that your re-purposed content is from a product that you&#x27;re currently making, and throw in a call to action for sign-ups.</li></ul><h1>Getting It Finished</h1><h2>Strategy #1: Make Public Promises</h2><p>Promising things to people on public platforms can make you feel accountable and motivated to deliver.</p><h3>STRATEGY #3 REDUCE SCOPE</h3><h2>Strategy #2: Email on a Schedule</h2><p>For Adam&#x27;s audience, emailing once a week makes sure people stay excited, and don&#x27;t forget about what he&#x27;s working on. Having an email schedule like that can help you feel like people are expecting content from you.</p><aside>I&#x27;m afraid to go a week without emailing people. </aside><h2>Strategy #3: Reduce Scope</h2><p>If you find you&#x27;ve been working on your product for 6 months, but there&#x27;s no end in sight, and you already have something substantial, then just move the finish line closer by reducing the scope of your project.</p><h1>Figuring Out Pricing</h1><h2>Topic #1: Tiered Pricing</h2><h3>Single Tier/No Tier Pricing</h3><ul><li>Can be fine if you can charge enough for your one tier.</li><li>Often necessary if you&#x27;re pre-selling.</li><li>Nice if you can&#x27;t figure out a way to add additional tiers that actually feel valuable.</li></ul><p>In general though, prefer multiple tiers.</p><h3>Two Tier Pricing</h3><p>Use price anchoring: make the second tier your real product, with the first tier as a reduced version of your product that really only exists to push people to the second tier. </p><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption>@wesbos&#x27;s second tier is only $10 more, but it has twice as much content, displaying the price anchoring strategy.</figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3001/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F8jjKhqg.jpg"/></figure></p><ul><li>The first tier makes second tier look like a better deal, since the prices are close.</li><li>This works well with video courses, where it&#x27;s easy to cut content for the budget version.</li></ul><h3>Three Tier Pricing</h3><ul><li>Great for books if you can come up with the bonus content.</li><li>Makes it easier for users to evaluate your product on its own instead of comparing it to Amazon book or something else.</li><li>Prices are usually 1x, ~2x, ~5x.</li><li>This will make you a lot more money from a book than just selling the book on its own.</li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption>Even though the top tier of Adam&#x27;s book Refactoring to Collections only sold 220 copies, it made the most money thanks to bonus content that wasn&#x27;t even as valuable as the book.</figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3001/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FXdTnSaI.png"/></figure></p><h2>Topic #2: Launch Discounts</h2><ul><li>Discount it by enough to be appealing, at least 30%.</li><li>Use stepped discounts. Lower discount on cheaper tiers and better discount on higher tiers will push people up to the better tiers.</li><li>Reverse engineer the non-discounted price from your planned discounted price. That means don&#x27;t discount the price you want to charge! Pick the price that you want to charge, make that the &quot;discounted&quot; price, and make the &quot;un-discounted&quot; price your preferred price plus whatever you&#x27;re taking off with the discount.</li></ul><h1>Nailing the Launch</h1><p>This is actually the easy part of the whole thing!</p><h2>Step #1: Build the Sales Page</h2><ul><li>Still include an email sign up! A lot of people are tire-kickers who are just on your page to see free content. Once you have their email though, you can try to sell them stuff.</li><li>Use testimonials and social proof. You can use feedback from preview content to start off.</li><li>Sort tiers from highest price to lowest price, and make sure your visuals communicate that your highest tier is the biggest, real product that people should want.</li></ul><h3>Step #2: Announce the Launch Details</h3><ul><li>Send out an email saying: I got it done. Include all package and pricing details, as well as the launch date.</li><li>If you can, send out some final free content.</li></ul><h3>Step #3: Launch It</h3><p>The easiest and most fun part!</p><ul><li>Send out a simple email: &quot;It&#x27;s available, all the info is here at the website.&quot;</li><li>Leverage your time zones if you need to. Adam uses morning Eastern Time Zone to launch things because he has a lot of European customers.</li><li>Pick you favorite day:</li></ul><aside>I like Tuesdays. I have no evidence, but it seems like a good day to launch things. Monday is too early, every other day seems too late. Tuesday seems fine. </aside><ul><li>Sit back and make money!</li></ul><h3>Step #4: Leverage Early Feedback</h3><p>You&#x27;re not done! You still have more emails to send.</p><ul><li>Catalog feedback from the first people who buy your product, including tweets like this one. </li></ul><p><figure class="sidecaption bottom"><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/philwinkle/status/733273064201392128">https://twitter.com/philwinkle/status/733273064201392128</a></figcaption><img src="http://localhost:3002/733273064201392128.png" alt=""/></figure></p><ul><li><p>A couple days later send an email to everyone that hasn&#x27;t bought your product yet with this early feedback, and a bunch more people will buy it!</p></li><li>Send another free preview if you can. Don&#x27;t be afraid of giving out free content! Adam has given out about 60% of his content for free.</li></ul><h3>Step #5: Closing the Launch</h3><p><strong>Controversial Advice:</strong> Don&#x27;t specify a closing date in advance.</p><ul><li>Having a specified launch closing date can make you feel obligated to shut down a launch discount that is making you tons of money. Adam has done that. It sucked.</li></ul><aside>I had a money hose that was just like firing money at me, and I was just like &quot;Oh, we gotta get this under control! We gotta turn this off! I don&#x27;t want this money!&quot;</aside><ul><li><p>Tell people that during the launch there will be a discount, and read the field of your sales to see when sales are dropping off. That&#x27;s the signal for the end of your launch. </p></li><li>Then, email people to tell them the launch is ending in a week. That will drive more sales, like a smaller, second launch week.</li></ul><h2><span><a href="https://gist.github.com/adamwathan/30dc4230ac575cfa3425b39ca11ea859">Adam&#x27;s Github Info Link</a><span class="foot">https://gist.github.com/adamwathan/30dc4230ac575cfa3425b39ca11ea859</span></span></h2><h1>Question</h1><p><strong>It looked like from your charts that you had huge revenue spikes at launch, but also a long tail of revenue on both products. Did you re-prime the pump?</strong></p><p>Those charts are just for the first three days, so that wasn&#x27;t a huge tail.</p><p>When I&#x27;ve released in early access before, it&#x27;s been easy to update people about new content, which gets new people to see and buy the product, especially since it was still at an early access price. </p><p>For my book, sales dropped off very seriously after the launch was over, which is why I feel like I made a big mistake in closing the launch after three days.</p><p>I got around this mistake a little by sending out an email telling people that they could still get the launch discount because I had gotten back feedback that people had just been unable to get to the launch discount in time. </p><p>In general now, I send people free content over 2 weeks after the launch, and if they haven&#x27;t bought the product by then I send them a coupon for a big discount that expires really soon, which encourages people to buy immediately.
