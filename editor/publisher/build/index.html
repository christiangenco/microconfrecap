<h2 id="whothehellisadamwathan">Who The Hell is Adam Wathan</h2>
<p>https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/989174075695120385</p>
<p>Adam started with a SaaS app that did just $3k in sales total. After that flopped, he was looking for another way to live on an online product.</p>
<p>The next thing he tried was launching an infoproduct - Refactoring to Collections (launched in May 2016)</p>
<p>In the first three days, it made $61k, so he quit his job!</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rBf7Rhd.png" alt="Refactoring to Collections launch sales" /></p>
<p>His next product was <a href="https://course.testdrivenlaravel.com/">Test Driven Laravel</a>, which made $116k in its first three days of launching.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0vNvKhC.png" alt="Adam Wathan knows how to do info products" /></p>

<h1 id="infoproducts">Info Products</h1>
<h2 id="whyaninfoproduct">Why an info-product?</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IvrS4Iq.jpg" alt="Rob Walling hadoukens his Stair Step approach - a great model for starting with an info-product" /></p>
<p>Why info-products?</p>
<ul>
<li>One-time purchase products are way easier to sell</li>
<li>They can be "done"; you don't have to maintain them forever</li>
<li>You can put one together in 3 months of nights and weekends</li>
<li>They put money in the bank fast then drop off, opposite of SaaS</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Selling subscription software is hard (courses are easy in comparison) @brennandunn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being able to do this full time is awesome.</p>
<h2 id="buildinganaudience">Building an Audience</h2>
<p>Why build an audience? It's really important that people trust you. Having a large audience can make up any other deficiency in your marketing plan. Having a large audience and no marketing strategy beats having a perfect marketing strategy and no audience.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Having a large audience can make up any other deficiency in your marketing plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You can't just throw up a landing page and expect people to sign up; people need to trust you and believe that you're the right person to help them.</li>
<li>Audience size is an exponential multiplier for product success.</li>
<li>No launch strategy + big audience &gt; Perfect launch strategy and no audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a strategy that works well for Adam.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Help people where they already are @wesbos</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/984500364245389312?lang=en</p>
<p>Adam does the same thing:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/829423543985307661?lang=en</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/steveschoger">steveschoger</a> in Setember 2016 had 436 twitter followers. He was just doing typical social media updates</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/c9CAktU.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>After posting more helpful tweets and helping people where they are, he's jumped to over 20k followers:</p>

<h2 id="pickingtherightidea">Picking the Right Idea</h2>
<h3 id="step1haveanidea">Step 1: Have an idea</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are you already putting out there that people seem excited about?</li>
<li>What are you excited about that you think others will get excited about?</li>
<li>What do people think you're better at than they are? What sorts of questions are people asking you? If people think you're better than them at something, that's an opportunity to teach.</li>
<li>What have you learned outside your community/watering hole that you think your community would benefit from?</li>
<li>What did you have to figure out yourself but was really helpful to learn? You could make it easier for other people.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>You could be the Christopher Columbus of programming knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="step2testit">Step 2: Test it</h3>
<p>Adam tests ideas with small tweets:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/956620857236959232</p>
<p>If it looks like things are working in a tweet format, he moves to a longer form (like high quality long-form comprehensive blog posts):</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/976909385938059264</p>
<p>Start cataloging any good feedback you get about this test content, like replies on Twitter, blog post comments, etc. It'll be useful very soon!</p>
<h3 id="step3definetheproduct">Step 3: Define the Product</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plan small; it will end up bigger than you think</li>
<li>Short books are still books. People don't want to read a 500 page book on something if they can read something in 4 hours that gets the same result.</li>
<li>3 hours is plenty for a video course</li>
<li>Books are a lot easier to work on, especially if you only have short blocks of time</li>
<li>Courses are easier to sell at a higher price but a lot harder to produce on nights and weekends</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="puttingupalandingpage">Putting up a Landing Page</h2>
<p>For <a href="https://adamwathan.me/advanced-vue-component-design/">Advanced Vue Component Design landing page</a>, Adam started with a clear headline on the value his users will get: "Learn how to design simpler, more flexible components that are both more powerful and easier to maintain."</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YVfPkj5.jpg" alt="Advanced Vue Component Design landing page has a clear value headline and call to action" /></p>
<p>Next, give them a <strong>clear incentive to sign up</strong>. Not just "sign up if you're interested" - give them a reason to give you their email address! Promise them some free content. In this example, "Sign up for free screencasts and a big discount when the course is released this May."</p>
<p>Next, give them some context to trust you: <a href="https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/">Renderless Components in Vue.js</a> proves Adam is an expert.</p>
<p>User testimonials are a great way to get social proof.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HhvcBAi.png" alt="If PJ Trainor trusts Adam, you should too" /></p>
<p>The more you can do to convince your audience that you're someone to be trusted, the better.</p>
<h3 id="shouldipresell">Should I pre-sell?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>I never felt happier than the day I finished my content. It felt like a huge burden lifted from me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adam has experimented with pre-selling on his info-products.</p>
<p>ADVANTAGES:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best form of <strong>product validation</strong>. If someone gives you money before you've created it, that's great proof that they're actually interested.</li>
<li>You'll <strong>make more money</strong>. You'll have more opportunity to promote it by telling people about updates without seeming spammy ("buy this! buy this! buy this!")</li>
<li>More <strong>motivation to finish</strong>. If you already have people's money, you'll push through burnout. You don't want to not deliver on something people have already paid you for.</li>
<li>Can <strong>buy you the time to focus on the product</strong>. If you have a successful pre-launch, you can afford to do less freelance work to buy more of your time.</li>
</ul>
<p>DISADVANTAGES</p>
<ul>
<li>Selling <strong>multiple tiers is trickier</strong>. It's harder to get people to buy the more expensive packages if right now they all get the same thing.</li>
<li>Can't easily <strong>change scope</strong>. Cutting scope is a great way to make your goal more attainable, but if you presell and promised too much you can end up in a situation where it takes you way longer to finish, which is a beat-down.</li>
<li>Like <strong>taking on debt</strong>, can be extremely stressful. Mechanically, pre-orders make you more money. Psychologically, it can be really stressful.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Holy fuck I gotta finish this thing people are gonna be so fucking angry." - maybe don't presell</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="buildingyouremaillist">BUILDING YOUR EMAIL LIST</h2>
<h3 id="step1tellyouraudience">STEP #1: TELL YOUR AUDIENCE</h3>
<p>Announce that you're going to announce your announcement before you announce it:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/978661856687484928</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Announce that you're going to announce your announcement before you announce it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You usually get your biggest spike in signups at launch. How can you sustain it?</p>
<h3 id="step2shareupdates">STEP #2 SHARE UPDATES</h3>
<p>Keep your list engaged and excited about the product by sharing updates:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/988443466890854402</p>
<p>If you don't have anything free to send out, just send out a work update:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/987362810521792512</p>
<h3 id="step3repurposecontent">STEP #3 REPURPOSE CONTENT</h3>
<p>If you're working on this full time, it can be hard to also be generating content to hype it up.</p>
<p>Try just repurposing your main content into a massaged blog post:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5YaplDi.png" alt="Repurpose content you already have" /></p>
<h2 id="gettingitfinished">Getting it Finished</h2>
<h3 id="strategy1makepromises">STRATEGY #1: MAKE PROMISES</h3>
<p>Making promises to your audience can keep you on track:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/982749280849940480</p>
<h3 id="strategy2emailonaschedule">STRATEGY #2: EMAIL ON A SCHEDULE</h3>
<p>For Adam's audience, emailing once a week is pretty good so they don't forget about what he's working on and stay excited. He's afraid to stop emailing people</p>
<h3 id="strategy3reducescope">STRATEGY #3 REDUCE SCOPE</h3>
<p>If you find you've been working on this for 6 months but there's no end in sight, but you <em>already have something substantial</em>, just move the finish line closer.</p>
<h2 id="figuringoutpricing">FIGURING OUT PRICING</h2>
<h3 id="topic1tieredpricing">TOPIC #1: TIERED PRICING</h3>
<p>SINGLE TIER</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be fine if you can charge enough</li>
<li>Often necessary if you're pre-selling</li>
<li>Nice if you can't figure out a way to add additional tiers that actually feel valuable In general, prefer multiple tiers</li>
<li>In general, prefer multiple tiers</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VkV1wZj.png" alt="People were willing to pay the top tier, so Adam never made the cheaper tiers" /></p>
<p>TWO TIERS</p>
<p>The first tier usually only exists to push people to the second tier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually a price anchoring strategy, first tier makes second tier look like better deal</li>
<li>Second tier is usually the "real" product</li>
<li>Prices are often close-ish, maybe 1x and 1.5x</li>
<li>Works well with video courses where easy to cut content for budget version</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8jjKhqg.jpg" alt="@wesbos's first tier only exists to price anchor to you to buy the second tier" /></p>
<p>THREE TIERS</p>
<ul>
<li>Great for books if you can come up with the bonus content</li>
<li>Makes it easier to evaluate as its own product instead of comparing to Amazon book prices Prices are usually 1x, ~2x, ~5x</li>
<li>This will make you a lot more money from a book than just selling the book on its own</li>
</ul>
<p>Refactoring to Collections has packages at $39, $79, and $179.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XdTnSaI.png" alt="Even though the top tier of Refactoring to Collections only sold 220 copies, it made the most money" /></p>
<h3 id="topic2launchdiscounts">TOPIC #2: LAUNCH DISCOUNTS</h3>
<p>TIPS</p>
<ul>
<li>Discount it by enough to be appealing, at least 30%</li>
<li>Use stepped discounts; lower discount on cheaper tiers and better discount on higher tiers</li>
<li>Discount it by enough to be appealing, at least 30%</li>
<li>Reverse engineer non-discounted price from your planned discounted price, it'll help you Charge More™.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Charge More™ @patio11</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="nailingthelaunch">Nailing the Launch</h2>
<p>This is actually the easy part of the whole thing.</p>
<h3 id="step1buildthesalespage">STEP #1: BUILD THE SALES PAGE</h3>
<ul>
<li>Still include an email sign up that sends preview content for new traffic. A lot of people are tire-kickers, just be careful you don't go to jail and get fined $20M euros.</li>
<li>Testimonials and social proof are important; use feedback from preview content to start</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step2announcethelaunchdetails">STEP #2: ANNOUNCE THE LAUNCH DETAILS</h3>
<p>TIPS</p>
<ul>
<li>Include all package and pricing details</li>
<li>Complete TOC or content list</li>
<li>Final free content preview if possible</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step3launchit">STEP #3 LAUNCH IT</h3>
<p>The easiest and most fun part!</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple email: "It's available, all the info is here at the website."</li>
<li>I like Tuesdays. I have no evidence but it seems at least as good as any other day. Morning EST works well for me</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>I like Tuesdays. I have no evidence but it seems at least as good as any other day</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've done all the stuff properly, you should be able to just sit back and watch the money roll in.</p>
<h3 id="step4leverageearlyfeedback">STEP #4: LEVERAGE EARLY FEEDBACK</h3>
<p>You're not done! You still have more emails to send. You'll start getting feedback, and you need to start cataloging it.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/philwinkle/status/733273064201392128</p>
<p>Send an email to everyone that hasn't bought it yet with this early feedback and a bunch more people will buy it.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of giving out free content! Adam gives out ~60% of the content for free.</p>
<h3 id="step5closingthelaunch">STEP #5: CLOSING THE LAUNCH</h3>
<p>Don't specify a closing date in advance.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Why did I do this? I had a firehose that was shooting money at me and I turned it off?!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recommend not specifying a pre-defined launch window. Let people make their own assumptions, and if anyone asks say "within the next couple of weeks."</p>
<p>Turning off a money hose sucks; announce the launch end date when the initial excitement has died down and use the urgency to drum up another round of sales.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<p><strong>You had huge spikes at launch, but also a long tail. Did you re-prime the pump?</strong></p>
<p>Those charts are just for the first few days - there's not a huge tail.</p>
<p>In general, I send people free content over 2 weeks from the landing page email CTA.

<blockquote>
  <p>Onboarding is really helping people get started and being successful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may wonder: “Is it crazy to worry about onboarding now?”</p>
<p><em>“Is it misguided to think about showing new users a product before you’ve built it?”</em></p>
<p>_“How can you even do onboarding before you have something to onboard someone onto?” _</p>
<p><em>“Uh…what’s onboarding?”</em></p>
<p>No! It will give you a huge advantage, and you should start now.</p>
<p>We'll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The forces that stop people from becoming customers</li>
<li>The information you need to design onboarding sequences</li>
<li>How to turn that information into messages to help people overcome the forces stopping them from becoming a customer</li>
</ul>
<p>Onboarding touches a little on copywriting, user research, and customer success.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yu0taji.png" alt="Don't actively make it more difficult for people to get started and solve their problems" /></p>
<p>This mountain is scary and hard because of a lot of <strong>hidden work</strong>. The “Hidden Work” in your SaaS trial includes things like….</p>
<ul>
<li>Forcing your users to figure out what to do first</li>
<li>Forcing your users to watch a 22 minute video before they can even get started</li>
<li>Forcing your users to become an expert on your product before they even know if they like it</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="productcentricwork">Product-Centric Work</h2>
<p>Product-Centric Work (aka, the work of figuring out how to use a new product)</p>
<p>Here are 3 examples of emails you may have gotten in your inbox.</p>
<h3 id="1thevacationphotosapproach">1. The Vacation Photos Approach</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dXzABJ9.png" alt="The Vacation Photos Approach sucks. Watching people's vacation photos is terrible." /></p>
<p>Your user just wants to do something simple - like importing their data. Don't make an onboarding experience. That makes it a lot harder to get started. Don't make your users watch your vacation videos before they can eat the deviled eggs.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Don't make your users watch your vacation videos before they can eat the deviled eggs.</p>

<h3 id="2thetoomuchtoosoonapproach">2. The “Too Much Too Soon” Approach</h3>
<p>Don't give people too many options. It doesn't increase the likelihood they'll take action on it.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6EZTmIk.png" alt="Each blue line is a call to action. Overwhelming!" /></p>
<h3 id="3thebadinternapproach">3. The “Bad Intern” Approach</h3>
<p>Don't make your users figure out what they need.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qlq6fz3.png" alt="The Bad Intern approach to onboarding - bleh" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eUYfuCI.png" alt="Don't give your users homework - help them solve their problems" /></p>
<p>People are signing up because they have a problem they want to solve. If you make it hard, only the most committed will get through your bad onboarding.</p>
<h3 id="abetterapproach">A Better Approach</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>No one wants software. Everyone wants their problems solved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5tfdgaK.png" alt="Create a Project! Yes, that's what I want to do. Great onboarding." /></p>
<p>What information do you need to build onboarding email sequences?</p>
<p>It doesn't have to look like a scary email sequence. Think about it as a series of emails that each want your user to do an action.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SG8tHN2.png" alt="28 emails are much simpler if you think of them as a series of actions that get your users to solve a problem" /></p>
<h2 id="internalwork">Internal Work</h2>
<p>Internal Work: aka, the work of forcing yourself to do the thing you think you might want to do</p>
<p>What’s the “job” that your customer hires you to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s going on in their world that made someone consider your product?</li>
<li>What outcome are they looking for?</li>
<li>What do they believe about their problem?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is effectively the <a href="https://microconf.gen.co/claire-suellentrop">Jobs to be Done</a> framework.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your customer’s biggest problem is unlikely to be that they want to try your features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your customer may hate software, but still have the pain your software solves.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M248mR7.png" alt="How to set up a Very Basic Onboarding Automation for a brand new product" /></p>
<p>Asking your cusomters "hey, what's going on in your world?" is a <strong>gold mine</strong> of data.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bmyCSs6.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you're doing this customer research, look for outcome phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>“so that”</li>
<li>“because”</li>
<li>“I want to”</li>
<li>“that way”</li>
<li>“so I can”</li>
<li>“I’ll be able to”</li>
<li>“what I want to do is”</li>
</ul>
<p>Where do you put this research? Try:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.airstory.co/">Airstory</a>: free tool for clipping, organizing, and writing with voice of customer data</li>
<li><a href="https://nomnominsights.com/">Nomnom</a>: aggregate customer feedback on an existing project</li>
<li><a href="https://usabilityhub.com/">Usability-Hub</a>: get feedback on usability</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't just <em>pretend</em> to go through UX research ("UX theatre"). Ex: find a random quote and try to pass it off as a customer quote.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/spydergrrl/status/955218540977631232</p>
<p>If your product isn't based in user feedback, you have a huge cultural problem.</p>
<h2 id="howdoyouwriteemails">How do you write emails?</h2>
<p>What should an onboarding email do? Get your customers to come back. Everyone is always leaving.</p>
<p>How? Three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Message-Matching: Get them to overcome their internal hurdles.</li>
<li>Instructions: eliminate the product-centric work involved with doing what you're asking them to do</li>
<li>Call to action: invite them to complete the action they need to take now.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6uHBS6z.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>BananaBlaster fictional example:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GhE0lG5.png" alt="BananaBlaster helps you keep track of your bananas" /></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/l87JoQf.png" alt="Exact Phrase Message Matching in action on BananaBlaster" /></p>
<p>Don't make people watch a 35 minute video, just tell them how to solve their problems.</p>
<p>You should also pay attention to how your customer is going to be using this information. Are they going to be on the subway and can't load your links?</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mkgbkXj.jpg" alt="Testing is Dead. Long Live Testing. You guys got that this is like &quot;The Queen is Dead Long Live the Queen&quot; right?" /></p>

<p>You can say "there are 35 ways to use this project" but it doesn't work as well as joining the conversation happening in your reader's head and solving the problem they're having <em>right now</em>.</p>
<p>Making it easy to get started works. Harvest's "Create a Project" email hasn't changed in years.</p>

<p>To help your customers get started, get the right mindset:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re teaching people something new</li>
<li>You’re solving their problems</li>
<li>You’re eliminating hidden work</li>

<p><strong>Do you start off users with the first email in each action?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, then drill down.</p>
<p><strong>In your examples of emails, they're all plaintext. We've noticed those do a lot better (because people are sick of the Mailchimp template). Our current onboarding series can't be plaintext because they have screenshots.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, start with plaintext. Also test what works best for you.</p>
<p><strong>You touched on the "what's up in your world" research emails and the "here's our product" call to action emails. Are those separate? In the same email?</strong></p>
<p>Do it separately. Keep people tightly focused on a single action.</p>
<p><strong>How do you consider in-app onboarding?</strong></p>
<p>You want both in-app and email onboarding. Email onboarding is for when they leave.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of onboarding in-app happens right when you sign up, but often people sign up at 2am when they're not ready to actually onboard.</p><h1>&quot;Why (and how) to start thinking about teaching people how to use your product... even if it isn't built yet&quot;</h1><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fteamlanio%2Fvideos%2F1677114439003846%2F&show_text=0&width=560" width="560" height="315" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>

<p>SaaS is supposed to be super exciting:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Gupffe5.png" alt="Expectation of revenue" /></p>
<p>But in practice it was really boring for Teachable:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nDPEiNk.png" alt="Teachable had a boring revenue slope" /></p>
<p>Here's how they did it over four years:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dmSzJU4.png" alt="Teachable's 4 year journey" /></p>
<p>It took 64 people to get there.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ehBQGCE.png" alt="Teachable overview at 10M ARR" /></p>
<h1 id="howteachablearchitectedgrowthonthebackend">How Teachable architected growth on the backend</h1>
<p>The growth model Teachable followed was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth was the priority.</li>
<li>How can we leave as little to chance as possible?</li>
<li>Let's take advantage of being small enough that we can strong-arm growth by doing things that do not scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>They waned to account for where every dollar was coming from.</p>
<p>Here's how it played out in August 2015:</p>
<ul>
<li>end of July 2015 MRR: $25k</li>
<li>Desire month-on-month growth rate: 30%</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/36Rd3Yq.png" alt="Calculating needed revenue to hit a target MRR" /></p>
<p><code>Math math math</code>, they needed $10,843 to hit 30% growth. Where does that come from?</p>
<p>If they <em>did nothing</em>, expected MRR would be $8k.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pPyzoNO.png" alt="Calculating expected MRR" /></p>
<p>"Revenue to be found" is therefore <code>$10,843 - $8,000 = $2,843</code>.</p>
<p>By the end, they "had to find" like a hundred thousand dollars, which was unfeasable. Early on, this number was a necessity that drove all marketing strategies. The number is also small enough to actually hit, and much better than just flying blind.</p>
<p>By targeting such a high number, they had to drive tactics that would have a shot in hell to hit the numbers.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VJS5SMP.png" alt="Example plan to hit the numbers: add in a few partner promos" /></p>
<h2 id="growthstrategiesateverygrowthstage">Growth Strategies at every growth stage</h2>
<p>To find an exrtra <strong>$500-$1k</strong>/month, the strategy could be 1-1 direct sales based on personally sent cold e-mails.</p>
<p>To find an extra <strong>$1k-3k</strong>, the revenue could be found by 1-many sales to our audience by hosting a big webinar every month.</p>
<p>The next level up in growth, <strong>$3k-$5k</strong>, could be found by hosting a weekly reoccurring webinar every Thursday driving $1k in new MRR / week.</p>
<p>A strategy to finding an extra <strong>$5k-$10k</strong>/month could be layering on joint venture webinars with influencers in the space every week with target of $1k in MRR / partner.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>At every stage, the necessity of having to discover this revenue was the fuel behind all of our big growth innovations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="dismalfailuresandsuccessfulstrategies">Dismal Failures and Successful Strategies</h2>
<p><strong>Idea 1</strong>: Pitch customers with a predesigned website with their content refactored and uploaded from other sites to impress them upfront.</p>
<p>That failed because Seth Goden's people complained about piracy :(</p>
<p><strong>Idea 2</strong>: A bot that tried to find e-mail addresses for everyone on Udemy and initiate a cold email from my personal Gmail telling them to use us instead.</p>
<p>That failed because the first person it "found" was the founder of Udemy :/</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wX1jeJA.png" alt="yikes" /></p>
<p><strong>Idea 3</strong>: Instead of inviting partners to our audience one at a time, why not aggregate all of them and have them all promote the same bigger event they all contribute to - aka "the summit"?</p>
<p>Oh hey that worked! $25k in new MRR from the first event, and eventually up to $50k in new MRR from repeating those events. This was one of the big pivot points that made Teachable work.</p>
<p><strong>Idea 4</strong>: Change the price of our Basic plan from $29 -&gt; $39 since we added a bunch of functionality to it. We experimented with letting existing users claim it at the old price for a week before the change went into effect.</p>
<p>Oh hey that worked too! Usually in a SaaS, your LTVs will slowly go up over time with a price raise. By letting people get grandfathered into the old price, it drove $20k in new MRR for the duration of the campaign immediately.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The necessity of "finding revenue" lead to the discovery of some of our best growth strategies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being driven by revenue goals helped sanity check projects that sounded great but wouldn't have driven growth.</p>
<p>Pulling this crazy growth out of nowhere month after month for 24 months had several secondary benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built momentum and morale internally - everyone wants to work on a “winning team”</li>
<li>Helped us raise capital at terms we wanted because of “traction”</li>
<li>Growth begets growth - the bigger you get, the more your "mini-brand" grows</li>
</ul>
<p>If Teachable failed to hit their growth, they could analyze why:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vOcEVZo.png" alt="If we failed to hit our growth goals, we'd know why" /></p>
<h2 id="whenthingscomecrashingdown">When things come crashing down</h2>
<p>After you're at ~$500k MRR, the "found revenue" gets insane:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/z7irlfb.png" alt="Where the growth model breaks down" /></p>
<p>Even if you earn $50k in a summit, you're barely making a dent in finding 6 figures a month. <strong>The strong arm method stops working.</strong></p>
<p>What do you do then? Look back to the product and customer. What if you could make another 5% from each existing customer?</p>
<h2 id="effectivegrowth20strategies">Effective Growth 2.0 Strategies</h2>
<p>After this $500k MRR inflection point, you have to move one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organic new customers added per day</li>
<li>Decreasing churn rate</li>
<li>Average revenue per customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>This method is more about repeatable growth and leveraging existing customers.</p>
<p>What does that look like?</p>
<p><strong>1. Over hire for customer success</strong>: During their scaling process, Teachable had as little as 1 Customer Care rep supporting every 1,000 paying customers. Today, it is 1 to 600.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xSLEnjM.png" alt="Customer metrics for Teachable improved dramatically by focusing on customer success" /></p>
<p>This also reduced churn. The difference between 5% and 6% churn at $500k MRR over 2 years will cover a payroll for <strong>20-30 customer care agents</strong>. Investing in customer success is worth it at this scale.</p>
<p><strong>2. Materially improve checkout product</strong>: Since we make money of payment processing, increased revenue per customer without needing new customers.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GanI2QT.png" alt="Improving the checkout to this slick single page increased sales from $250k/day to $400k/day" /></p>
<p><strong>3. Make the $99/month plan more attractive</strong>: average customer revenue per paying customer jumped from $48/customer to $60/customer (today it's $67).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WMtfnBr.png" alt="Making the $99/month plan more attractive changed the slope of Teachable's growth rate" /></p>
<h2 id="dontmakethesamemistakesasteachable">Don't make the same mistakes as Teachable</h2>
<p>Teachable spent ~6 months after hitting $500k MRR trying to do one off activities to make the math work, which wasn't sustainable (but worked super well up to $500k MRR).</p>
<p>They now divide growth into <strong>strong-armed growth</strong> and <strong>evergreen growth</strong> (growth that moves organic customers added per day, churn rate, or average revenue per customer).</p>

<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<p><strong>This seems to go against the advice of doing one thing well. How do you reconcile your one-off growth projects with that?</strong></p>
<p>We never found one strategy to grow that continued to work. There was no single channel we could focus on and still hit our numbers.</p>
<p><strong>How many people did you have dedicated to growth at each stage?</strong></p>
<p>It was never smaller than 4 people. Right now our growth team is like its own mini company (even with its own engineers) - about 16.</p>
<p><strong>Should I focus on growth or product first?</strong></p>
<p>Once you have some kind of product market fit, don't use product improvements as an excuse to not push on growth. You'll never feel ready enough.</p><h1>undefined</h1><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.facebook.com%2Fteamlanio%2Fvideos%2F1677163055665651%2F&show_text=0&width=560" width="560" height="315" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Prevailing wisdom says to make your customers happy. Is this true?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effortless-Experience-Conquering-Battleground-Customer/dp/1591845815">The Effortless Experience</a>, making your customers happier makes them more loyal.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AIs2P2o.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>But in practice, you can make customers really happy and they still churn.</p>
<p>On the flip side, really angry customers that complain all the time in your support can stick around <em>forever</em>.</p>
<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>There's a difference between <strong>meeting the needs of the customer</strong> and <strong>delighting the customer</strong>. By meeting your customer's needs, you're already doing the most economically viable thing you can do.</p>

  <p>Great products don't make successful customers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Example 1: Docker went from 2,500 job postings in 2014 to 43,000 in 2015. Massive imbalance in supply/demand.</li>
<li>Example 2: Fender Guitars churn went from 40% to 90% over ten years</li>
<li>Example 3: Drip opened up a free plan after their acquisition. It drove growth, but got a completely different type of customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all these examples, the company is great, but there's a problem with the customer.</p>
<p>What did they do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Docker: training program to get more people certified</li>
<li>Fender: $10/month guitar education app</li>
<li>Drip: instead of focusing on how to use Drip, Drip is focusing on teaching businesses the principles of marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes help users use the product more, use more features, and work more independently.</p>
<p>These are all metrics of <strong>effective adoption</strong>. Don't ask if your customer is happy, measure how</p>

<h1 id="thepayoffrenewaltime">The Payoff: Renewal Time</h1>
<p>Typically, sometime before you charge a user you send the user an email letting them know they're going to get a bill.</p>
<p>If you get fancy, you might inject some dynamic stuff showing the user how much they used the product.</p>
<p>The unconventional way is to have a relationship with each customer and when it's time to renew, you <strong>upsell them</strong>. This upsell needs to be based in what the customer's need is.</p>
<h1 id="finalthoughts">Final Thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>happy customers still churn</li>
<li>our product probably isn't enough to get <em>all</em> users to be successful</li>
<li>focus on the needs of your customer, not delighting them. Don't be afraid to say "no" to two-hour calls for a $10/month customer so you can be freer to help higher valued customers to achieve their goals.</li>
<li>Be judicious with high touch customer service. Reserve it for people that give you a lot of money.</li>

<p>This stuff needs to get done, so Brian set up a process to get them done automatically.</p>
<p>As an example, here's what that process looks like for finding interesting guests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Manually find the first few guests</li>
<li>List places where interesting guests can be found (like other podcasts, communities, customers, etc.)</li>
<li>Producer/editor suggests potential guests from those places in a gravity form with a brief (website, point of interest, other interviews)</li>
<li>Brian approves or denies the suggestion with a reason why (so the process can be improved)</li>

<p># 6 pitfalls to avoid  when raising money</p>
<h2 id="pitfall1casuallyraisingmoney">Pitfall #1: Casually Raising Money</h2>
<p>You're not really raising money if you're doing it casually.</p>
<p>If you're not keeping in contact with your investors, they'll question your commitment.</p>
<p>If you're not putting your investors to work, they'll lose the inclination to help.</p>
<p>## Pitfall #2:  Having poor timing</p>
<p>Don't go out for funding too early or you'll have to prove more faster.</p>
<p>Don't wait too long to get funding or the walls will be closing in.</p>
<h2 id="pitfall3goingafterthewrongaudience">Pitfall #3: Going after the wrong audience</h2>
<p>Bigfoot has a scoped-down list. If your list is too big, it's unfocused and your investors will question your targeting ability. Target around 30 investors.</p>
<p>## Pitfall #4 : Having Unreal Expectations</p>
<p>If your investor list is too small (like 2 people), you need to broaden your scope.</p>
<p>If your investment window is too small, you'll lose steam.</p>
<p>If you overestimate your value, you'll shrink your market and turn groups off.</p>
<p>## Pitfall #5 : Overoptimizing</p>
<p>Overoptimizing feels like death by a thousand cuts.</p>
<p>If you're constantly renegotiating, good faith goes down the drain.</p>
<p>If you're overemphasizing edge cases, your judgement will be called into question.</p>
<p>If you can't get comfortable, your investors will start doubting their investment late in the game.</p>
<p>## Pitfall #6:  Not thinking ahead</p>
<p>It’s easy to jeopardize future capital raises</p>
<p>If you only do what's comfortable, you'll get lazy and pay less attention. If you lock yourself by taking financing, you reduce optionality of taking future capital.</p>
<h1 id="recap">Recap</h1>
<p>Raising capital is basically sales. If sales isn’t your thing, find help.</p>
<p>You have processes for other parts of your business, so have one here.</p>
<p>Investors are skeptical. Use the process to reduce their doubt.</p>

<p>Then he decided to sell BromBone and go back to what he knew: a side project moving downmarket to selling physical boardgame tables.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9dCVBPj.jpg" alt="BoardGameTables.com" /></p>
<p>BoardGameTables.com sells high end custom tables for an average of $3,500. Their June 2016 Kickstarter raised <strong>$2.6M</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the anti-microconf business. Here's what workes well in BoardGameTables that goes against Microconf wisdom.</p>
<h2 id="1recurringrevenueisoverrated">1. Recurring Revenue is Overrated</h2>
<p>Even though selling board game tables doesn't generate recurring revenue (<code>growth_rate == churn_rate</code>), the business still works.</p>
<p>There are a lot of perks to the one time sales model, though. One time sales mean you get your customer's Lifetime Value (LTV) up front.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If my LTV is higher than my Cost to Acquire a Customer and the cost to give that customer what they ordered then I make profit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bad: Income Delayed
Bad: Harder Sale
Good: Can Increase LTV by Lowering Churn or Adding Expansion Revenue</p>
<p>Can you get both recurring revenue and get all the revenue up front? No, those are literally opposite.</p>
<h2 id="2annualplansareoverrated">2. Annual Plans Are Overrated</h2>
<p>When Chad sold BromBone, he used FE International as a broker. And they had all these questions about my annual plans.</p>
<p>It's easy to mask churn problems, but you should fix them instead. A customer is churned when they stop using your product, not when they stop paying.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A customer is churned when they stop using your product, not when they stop paying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes there are customers who are destined to churn.</p>
<p>For example, sometimes BromBone would lose a customer because they went out of business.</p>
<p>You can’t really fix that. So, maybe it is a good idea to try to collect as much as you can upfront.</p>
<p>But Chard argues that you’re still missing the point. Your path to growth isn’t maximizing your revenue from bad customers. Maximize for your good customers.</p>
<p>Of course, there are reason to have annual plans</p>
<p>Just make sure you are doing it because they are right for your business and not because you are copying what everyone else is doing.</p>
<p>If you aren’t restrained by cashflow, then I would give serious pause before offering much of a discount for annual plans.</p>
<h2 id="3itispossibletomovedownmarket">3. It is Possible to Move Down Market</h2>
<p>Moving down market is different than charging less.</p>
<p>When Chad launched his Kickstarter for a new model of table, the table was clearly differentiated (that’s business speak for it’s not as good). It opened up new customers who were NEVER going to buy the more expensive product.</p>
<p>The high end tables lost some sales to cannibalization, but they also gained some because of greater brand awareness.</p>
<p>The process has been super hard.</p>
<p>If this were MicroConf Starter, Chad would just say no. Don’t do it.</p>
<p>But since this is growth, he believes it is possible, just:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the product is different</li>
<li>Make sure you are going to reach audience that is both NEW and LARGER.</li>
<li>Be ready to work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4overratedb2bjustshowpositiveroi">4. Overrated: B2B = Just Show Positive ROI</h2>
<p>A big reason that people recommend starting a B2B business is that if you just show a positive ROI to customers then businesses will buy from you.</p>
<p>Afterall, that is what businesses do. If they can give you $1000 and it makes them $2000, then it is a no brainer.</p>
<p>The great thing about B2C is that you don’t have to show a positive ROI.</p>
<p>It can be tricky to prove that positive ROI in practice.</p>
<p>There are setup expenses, opportunity costs, attribution problems (was that new revenue really because we are using your product, or would we have gotten the sale anyway)</p>
<p>There are unknowns. You just can’t account for everything</p>
<p>With B2C you just have to make them want it.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When B2C, you just have to make them want it. Is your product pretty? Are cool kids using it? Can they brag about it? It doesn't have to be logical.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="5listentopodcastsat1x">5. Listen to Podcasts at 1x</h2>
<p>Seriously. You don’t have to cram information into your ears as fast as possible. Take a deep breath and relax. Use the slower speed to allow your mind to wonder. To have its own ideas and go on its own tangents. It will be ok.</p>
<p>chad@boardgametables.com</p><h1>&quot;Everything You've Learned at MicroConf is Wrong*&quot;</h1><p>What is the Goal?</p>
<ul>
<li>Validate an idea? Try flipping that to invalidating your idea.</li>
<li>Learn and adapt</li>
<li>Find product / market fit</li>
</ul>
<p>Product / Market Fit</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not just interest</li>
<li>True test is $$, but that's hard to get in the beginning</li>
<li>Look for a switch from you pushing to them pulling</li>
<li>See the user imagining their life with the product, and planning for it. That's a great sign.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things to Test and Adjust</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem: what you're trying to solve.</li>
<li>Product: what you build to address it</li>
<li>Market: who you're selling it to, price point, the person you're selling to vs. person using it</li>
<li>Wording: use words your customers use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding People to Talk To</p>
<ul>
<li>Your current network - don't ignore this! Just casually talk to friend about what you're trying to do. Does your uncle own a business in the space? Talk to them!</li>
<li>Become a visible expert in the space. Long term but great strategy. Meetups and blogs make it easier to find people.</li>
<li>Conferences / events / meetups. These are good, but make sure they're the places your users go to learn new things ("watering holes")</li>
<li>Cold emails. Keep it short and make it easy to respond. You can also find a way to personally connect, which increases the response rate ("I'm also in Indy!"), then <strong>follow up</strong>! "Did you get my last email?" =&gt; "oh yeah, I meant to respond but I was busy"</li>
</ul>
<p>Conducting the Interview</p>
<ul>
<li>In person &gt; video &gt; phone &gt; email. Email is fine for a simple single response, but you get a lot of value from seeing a person's face.</li>
<li>Ask to record. It's going to go fast. Focus on engaging the person instead of collecting information.</li>
</ul>
<p>What NOT to Do</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t talk very much</li>
<li>Don’t put ideas in their heads. Try to get their wording.</li>
<li>Don’t describe your solution. This is hard. You can mention it at the end, but if you mention it too early you'll muddle up their words.</li>
<li>Don’t ask what they want. People don't know what they want!</li>
<li>Don't ask yes or no questions - "does that sound like a good solution?" cuts off information too soon. Change it to something like "How does that problem rank among your day to day priorities", or "why might that work or not work for your business?" "Who are two or three other people who might be interested to talk about this?" is harder not to answer than "Do you know anyone else I could talk to?"</li>
</ul>
<p>What to Ask About</p>
<ul>
<li>Factual questions</li>
<li>Past behavior</li>
<li>How things operate now</li>
<li>What they don’t want</li>
<li>What they see others doing. The aspirational question! What do you want to be doing? These are words you can use in your marketing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dig In Deeper</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand why. Ask “Interesting - tell me more about that.”, “… how does that work?”, “Describe how…”, “What was a time when…”. Get them talking about their process and try to understand why they operate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Competing Products</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t despair - that’s good! Super valuable information</li>
<li>Ask what they like</li>
<li>Ask what they don’t like</li>
<li>“What would it take for you to switch?” This is a great question to mine for marketing language.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask for Referrals. If you don't get one right away, say "that's alright, I'll follow up in a few days"</p>
<ul>
<li>Warm leads respond MUCH better than cold leads. 5-10x better.</li>
<li>Doesn’t have to be on the call - say you’ll email later to ask</li>
<li>Can ask for an intro email</li>
</ul>
<p>After the Interview</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow up! Prepare them with a “I’ll definitely let you know when I have more to show you.”</li>
<li>Make changes. There's no point to the interviews if you're not making any changes.</li>
<li>Do more interviews until you stop learning new things. Everyone wants a number - it's going to be different from market to market. 10 is easy to remember, but you actually want to keep going until you stop learning. Also, do interviews again after a few months! Maybe the market changed, maybe you have a bigger audience.</li>

<p>When marketing a product, it’s common for founders to focus on the product itself. “Look at our cool features! We help you do XYZ activity, but better!” This is a recipe for getting lost in the noise, and for losing to competitors with deeper pockets.</p>
<p>Instead, capturing your customer’s attention requires focusing on her ultimate motivation (“job to be done”), which is to transform her current life-situation into a preferred one.</p>
<p>After this talk, you’ll walk away with:</p>
<p>– An understanding of the “jobs to be done” theory
– An understanding of how JTBD helps companies create effective positioning
– A proven, step-by-step process for uncovering your customer’s ultimate motivation (“job to be done”)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4LCHoMl.png" alt="Have you ever described your product like this? It's fine, just don't rely on them day-in day-out to differentiate your product" /></p>
<p>Your customers do want to be saving time. They probably also want to save money, but you need to <strong>get more specific</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oSwga9E.jpg" alt="How do appointment scheduling tools describe themselves?" /></p>
<p>Appointment scheduling tools describe themselves very generically: "powerful system", "robust feature set", "save time", and "easy-to-use".</p>
<p>There's a big problem with these generic descriptions: <strong>They're abstract</strong>: you wouldn't sell groceries as individual ingredients, you'd <strong>sell the cake</strong>. To capture people's imagination, you need to <strong>get specific and vivid</strong>. This is way more important if you're on a crowded market.</p>
<h2 id="ynabexample">YNAB Example</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vTPRR7J.jpg" alt="YNAB made a feature change that made it much harder to keep track of overspending, which is super stressful" /></p>
<p>What should Claire do? What product should she switch to that will solve the pain point of this one feature breaking?</p>
<p><strong>"Ready to take control of your finances?"</strong> - well, no, I'm looking for a solution to solve this pain from YNAB</p>
<p><strong>"Take control of your finances with Quicken"</strong> - uhh these all sound the same</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ywrb1OB.jpg" alt="Products with generic swappable headlines are like Zebras fading into eachother" /></p>
<h2 id="jobstobedone">Jobs to Be Done</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Jobs To Be Done is the theory that p ople buy and use a product because they want to make themselves better in particular ways</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kale-Coffee-Renegades-Happiness-Longevity/dp/1401946186">Coffee and Kale</a> talks more about Jobs to be Done.</p>
<p>Job story: When <strong>_</strong>, help me <strong>_</strong>, so I can <strong>__</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/k9UXpGQ.png" alt="Job story: when _, help me _, so I can _ " /></p>
<p>For this YNAB example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When</strong> my partner has made work-related purchases, and we know we'll be reimbursed for those purchases at the end of the quarter…</li>
<li><strong>Give me</strong> the flexibility to separate those purchases from the rest of our spending…</li>
<li><strong>So I can</strong> plan next month's budget <em>without</em> the stress of creating easy-to-screw-up workarounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this an edge case? Not according to Reddit's community:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZQQxCYl.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/G9NPXjq.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>People are not happy with YNAB. If you were a competitor, think of how effective it would be to take these words and use them on your landing page!</p>
<p>Instead of "Ready to take control of your finances?", try "The only way to fully customize the way you manage your money painlessly."</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Km5O4z4.jpg" alt="This copy change had a 200% increase in conversions from the homepage to the pricing page" /></p>
<p>How do you figure out the job your product does for your customers? Getting a handful of customers on the phone (customer interviews) can color in any gaps leftover from traditional surveys.</p>
<h2 id="tactics">Tactics</h2>
<p>Get templates of these survey and interview templates at <a href="https://userlist.io/microconf">userlist.io/microconf</a>.</p>
<p>Surveys:</p>
<ul>
<li>build a short (~5 questions) survey (Typeform makes it easy to include hidden fields) from <a href="https://userlist.io/microconf">a template</a></li>
<li>identify 1-200 of your most high-value customers</li>
<li>email them the survey from a real person (but hold back about 40 customers to use for interviews later)</li>
<li>aim for 25-50 results</li>
</ul>
<p>Interviews:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pRZTFbt.png" alt="Your interviews provide extra context" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Invite the held-back 40 high-value customers to a 30-minute interview with a link to schedule. People love getting on this call and talking about themselves! You'll probably get a ~20% success rate.</li>
<li>Aim for 10 interviews.</li>
<li>Don't ask people what they think of your new features (people are bad at answering questions like that). Try to get an idea of why they did decisions in the past. "What did your life look like before our product? What happend that led you to start seeking something like our product? Once you found us, what made you sign up for the trial?"</li>
<li>Record these calls - raw language is amazing for copy and developing stronger positioning. You'll use this to mirror your customer's language back at them. You can use <a href="https://rev.com">Rev.com</a> to transcribe them for $1/minute.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you'll have a lot of data to start building a Jobs to be Done story, and you can do it in your customer's language.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5hI2YoU.png" alt="You'll start seeing patterns in survey results" /></p>

<p><strong>What do you do when you have a lot of verticals you're targeting? Landing pages?</strong></p>
<p>Your homepage is like an Airport: some people want pricing, some want jobs, some want to contact support.</p>
<p>Landing pages is a great move. <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> also used to have two browser tabs to segment agency owners vs. business owners. If people can self-select on their homepage you can speak to people more strongly.</p>

<p><strong>When choosing the high value customers, should you let them settle into your product?</strong></p>
<p>Aim for the people who have been in the product for a while.

<p>Runway is how long you have left until your business is dead. How do you navigate it? Just become cashflow positive before you run out of money.</p>
<p>How? The same way a pilot takes off a plane: know your plane's metrics, have your eyes at the end of the runway, and make sure you're prepared for takeoff.</p>
<p>This isn't how it always works out though.</p>

<p>"And then I ran out of all my cash. I was $4,000 in debt, so I had to put up the website for my last idea to collect money. I created, tested, and launched it in just a couple days…"</p>

<li>What do they read, watch, or listen to?</li>
<li>What makes them angry?</li>

<p>Maybe one out of a million company has a growth hack, but it won't be your company.</p>
<p>There is no magical viral growth step at the bottom of the climbing wall that launches you to the top. It's hard. Every step takes effort and attention. If you stop climbing, you stop progressing.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yorJlIQ.jpg" alt="IndieHacker readers complained that Jason had it too easy because he already had a successful blog" /></p>
<p>This growth wasn't as easy as it looked. It was a long hard slow slog:</p>
<p>"I hand tailored more than 1,000 emails to blogs. It took me five months of doing it every day. They didn't respond, so I would tweet them, I would Facebook message them, I'd send SoundCloud messages, I'd send another email. Then I'd try and find another contact. And we're still sort of doing this today. Those 250 blogs and labels didn't come overnight."</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tvKuoSg.jpg" alt="The first step is the simplest. You don't need a brilliant strategy early on." /></p>
<p>It's okay that you started small. Now there are new steps that are easier to reach.</p>
<p>Keep climbing! Nobody else jumped straight to the top. You'll never find new steps unless you try.</p>
<p>Plan your route. See what paths others took. Look multiple steps ahead. Steps like starting a mailing list make it much easier later on.</p>
<p>Stay on track to your destination. The higher you climb, the more distracting options. Having a clear vision makes it easy to say "no" to things that don't get you closer.</p>

<p>Can you imagine if users had to pay $0.05 per google search? Let's see how well google does with different levels of searching:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Level 0: dog</li>
<li>✅ Level 1: jack russell</li>
<li>✅ Level 2: jack russel smiling</li>
<li>👎 Level 3: black and white jack russel smiling (google starts to slip here)</li>
<li>🚫 Level 4: black and white jack russel smiling next to a baby (google doesn't know what it's doing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once searches get past Google's level of expertise (~level 3), the results start slipping.</p>

<p>Dave's idea of growth is closer to the metal: having better relationships with people.</p>
<p>As an example, Dave set up a chat app on his website that goes directly to his cellphone. Having more authentic relationships turns customers into his sales team.</p>

<p>Garrett started Sifter in 2008 because the world needed yet another bug tracker. It fit well with his medical struggles.</p>
<p>He sold that and started working for Wildbit - it was a great decision to accept he didn't have to be his own boss for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>In the early days of Sifter during a server upgrade, Garrett had a decision to make that was moderately time sensitive.</p>
<p>In a hurry, he made a bad choice and deleted 8 hours of customer data. If he had stopped to collect himself instead of acting quickly, he wouldn’t have made the mistake. He knew Sifter was going out of business. In my head.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/N6N6zb4.png" alt="After losing 8 hours of customer data, Garrett knew his life was over" /></p>
<p>It wasn't actually that bad, though! He learned that <strong>responding beats reacting</strong>. Things will go wrong. Focus on the aspects you can affect.</p>

<h3 id="version1ofgarrettsleg">Version 1 (of Garrett's Leg)</h3>
<p>Let’s try the simplest solution.</p>
<p>Recurring revenue from Sifter was an amazing form of disability insurance. It was easy to be scared of health issues, but recurring revenue makes it easier.</p>
<p>Pivoting: We learned a little. Some stuff worked. Some didn’t. It’s time to get serious.</p>
<p>Garrett read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unthinkable-Scott-Rigsby/dp/1414333145">Unthinkable by Scott Rigsby</a> going through negative visualization. This dude won the Hawaiian triathalon. The worst case isn't that bad!</p>
<p>Maintain perspective. Not “Well. It could be worse.” But rather “I can handle this.”</p>
<h3 id="version20ofgarrettsleg">Version 2.0 (of Garrett's Leg)</h3>
<p>We feel confident that the best step is to invest in a more ambitious solution.</p>
<p>Garrett committed to what was supposed to be an 8 hour surgery and ~1 week in the hospital. It ended up being two 10 hour surgeries and 3 weeks in the hospital.</p>
<p>He learned that tiny steps are still steps. The key is that they’re your steps. Don’t compare your rate of progress to anyone else. (Or to “past you.”). The challenges you’re facing are uniquely yours. Don’t get distracted comparing your journey to anyone else’s. Or even past you.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 of Garrett's leg was a "free flap" (a skin graft + a chunk of ham from Garrett's thigh), but it didn't work.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Don’t worry, there are plenty of places I can take the flap from.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Garrett learned to trust and delegate. Don’t give up when your first attempt doesn’t go well. In our personal lives, we don’t hesitate to trust experts, but with business, too often we try to go it alone.</p>
<p>Even though Garrett's doctor wasn’t confidence inspiring, he was the best person for the job. There was no way I was going to give up and try to do it myself. Yet, in business, all too often, that’s what we do. Delegation is a learned skill, and it’s inherently dependent upon both the delegator and the delegatee.</p>
<h3 id="version21ofgarrettsleg">Version 2.1 (of Garrett's leg)</h3>
<p>Any major effort is going to run into issues and need some follow-on work. Garrett's doctors had already taken one flap from my left leg. They’d need to get another flap. This meant an extended stay in the ICU. 🏥</p>
<p>He did get a magic morphine button 🔘💊, but his heart rate would go below the alarm level when he tried to sleep. Pain killers. No sleep. Barely eating. A couple of panic attacks. He was in bad shape.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“We’ll keep you here a few more days and then we’ll move you to the floor.” …the floor?!?! What the hell kind of hospital is this?!?!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was at this point that Garrett reached out to Chris and Natalie (the founders of Wildbit).</p>
<p>Progress isn't automatic. Growing pains are real. At some point, growth will plateau. “If you build it, they will come.” Right? Nope. Growing a business takes deliberate and directed action. Even then, it’s slow.</p>
<p>Garrett learned that growth is just a formula. You have to look at growth and plateaus as simple formulas. Then set goals accordingly. When your business isn’t growing, it’s easy to question literally everything. However, you have to remember it’s just simple math. And that math can tell you <em>exactly</em> what you need to work on. The good news is that you can see these limits coming a mile away. They should never surprise you.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zltaN4I.png" alt="When your business isn’t growing, it’s easy to question literally everything. However, you have to remember it’s just simple math. And that math can tell you _exactly_ what you need to work on." /></p>
<p>Garrett learned to work on the right things. The likelihood of working on the right things correlates closely with what customers are telling you combined with your actual growth numbers. Choosing the right things to work on will always be difficult. However, if you understand this formula and break it down, you have some built-in guidance from the business about where you should focus your efforts.</p>
<p>How do you grow? One of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce Churn</li>
<li>Increase Conversion</li>
<li>Increase Traffic</li>
</ol>
<p>Physical therapy is a great metaphor for business. I’ve spent an inordinate amount of time in physical therapy, and it’s very cyclic. It’s about cycles of pain, improvement, plateaus, and making the adjustments to push through the plateaus.</p>
<p>It’s the same thing with our businesses or careers.</p>
<p>When you first learn a new skill or set out on a new path, it’s really difficult. Then it gets easier. Then you get comfortable.</p>
<p>You constantly have to push yourself outside of your comfort zone in order to grow.</p>
<p>This is especially true running a business. With each new achievement, you’re going to be playing a new game. You have to adjust.</p>
<p><strong>Pain and discomfort are part of the process.</strong> Go right up to your limit. Push past it. Suffer a little. Then do it all over again.</p>
<h3 id="stepbackandassess">Step back and assess</h3>
<p>How are you doing? Are you meeting your goals? Do you need to try something new?</p>
<p>For Garrett, it was a major surgery. In business, it may be a major feature release. As things change, it’s important to revisit them and take a critical look at where you’re at.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6ivx27B.png" alt="For Garrett, recovery plateaued, and his foot wasn’t back in the right position yet." /></p>
<p>He learned to focus on tangible goals rather than long-term dreams. Let your dreams light the fire, but remember that incremental and measurable goals are how you really get there.</p>
<p>For him, the dream was being active again. Playing basketball. Snowboarding. Running. Going hiking or camping with my family. The goals were much smaller: Walk a single mile. Run a single mile. Run a 5k.</p>
<p>In business, it’s the same. Having your business support you full-time is a dream, not a goal. Finding 5 more customers is an actionable goal. Don’t worry about two years from now. Focus on here and now, and two years will get here fast.</p>
<h3 id="makebigdecisions">Make big decisions</h3>
<p>Turning points are never easy, and the answer is rarely obvious.</p>
<p>You will face turning points where you have to make big decisions. For Garrett, it was an ankle fusion or amputation. Fusion effectively meant no running or jumping ever again.</p>
<p>Lesson: protect your focus for the things that really matter, and always work deliberately.</p>
<p>Don’t avoid big decisions because they’re hard. Put your head down, do the research, decide, and then execute ruthlessly.</p>
<p>Elective amputation is about as scary of a decision as you can make. The permanence is really all that makes it scary though.</p>
<p>The good news with business is that nothing is permanent. You can always go back and fix it.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YDde6OO.jpg" alt="Garrett's ankle. Out of position. Arthritic. He talked to 4 surgeons, and they all advised an ankle fusion." /></p>
<p>So what’s the deal with amputation again? Just how active can you be? What are the limitations? Thanks to the books and talking to other amputees, Garrett wasn’t scared of amputation.</p>
<p>He was scared of the permanence and of being wrong, but he was at peace with it pretty quickly.</p>
<p>All of the amputees he talked to had regret. Specifically, they had one regret…</p>
<p>…the exact same regret.</p>
<p>They wished they had done it sooner.</p>
<p>At this point, Garrett and his wife had their second daughter. He was still running Sifter effectively by myself.</p>
<p>The idea of another major surgery at this point means a lot of burden on Lauren to take care of her family.</p>
<p>Fusion would theoretically be a quicker recovery (~3-6 months) with fewer short-term restrictions.</p>
<p>Amputation would mean pushing a lot onto Lauren for the foreseeable future. (~18 months to a full recovery)</p>
<p>This is a nerve-wracking decision. Amputation felt like it had the best potential for a good long-term outcome.</p>
<p>Fusion felt like the safe and responsible thing for Garrett's family as a whole. Yet. With amputation he saw liberation. With a fusion, he only saw shackles.</p>
<p>And so they put screws in Garrett's foot. It was the safe play. He originally thought it would be a 6-month detour at worst. They ended up giving it (and other treatments) 18 months.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ARkrFf5.jpg" alt="Screws in Garrett's foot was the safe play" /></p>
<p>Some time after the fusion, Garrett talked to Wildbit again, but this time, there was a way to move on from Sifter.</p>
<p>The weight of running a business and feeling an obligation to customers for years of neglect was at odds with the same feelings towards family.</p>
<p>Joining Wildbit was key. He was a terrible boss for himself. Wildbit on the other hand is the healthiest workplace he could imagine. It had been absolutely critical to his recovery.</p>
<p><strong>For some decisions, there’s not an obvious answer.</strong> You may need to make a leap of faith. Do your research, and make a decision. Sitting still can often be worse.</p>
<h2 id="isitgoodenough">Is it good enough?</h2>
<p>After big efforts, launch, and then re-evaluate. Here we are again, only now I had real data on what a fusion was like.</p>
<p>Chronic pain. Middling functionality.</p>
<p>But he could get by, but was “getting by” enough?</p>
<p>The thing about amputation is that it’s so permanent. There’s no Command-Z. No matter how confident I could have been, it’s scary.</p>
<p>He had to have a framework to weight it all.</p>
<p>Garrett questioned what he was capable of. Are those activities pain-free enough to be enjoyable?</p>
<p>He tried playing basketball again, but could only tolerate about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Soon, the pain and disability from ankle fusion was bad enough that Garrett started to see that amputation would be better for his family too. It was clear that if functionality was important to Garrett, the fusion wasn’t going to cut it.</p>
<p>Around the same time, after spending 8 years on Sifter and having it financially support him, he sold it. Sifter was in good hands, and he could finally focus more on his recovery or maybe amputation.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t count on data and logic to provide the right answer.</strong> Too often we try to be 100% confident about decisions that require a leap of faith. These days, there’s so much talk about A/B testing and data. That stuff’s useful, but you can convince yourself of anything.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the early days of a business, you won’t have statistical significance.</p>
<h3 id="takingthenextstep">Taking the next step</h3>
<p>Once you’ve handled the basics, the real work begins.</p>
<p>~5 months from deciding to amputate to actually having it. Schedule/rescheduled a couple of times as we tried some other options.</p>
<p>Opportunities to cancel it kept popping up, but I finally said “enough.”</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dJIxtzp.jpg" alt="Waking up with just one leg" /></p>
<p><strong>It’s ok to let go.</strong> Just because something is holding you back, doesn’t mean you have to hold on too.</p>
<h3 id="thejourneyneverends">The journey never ends</h3>
<p>There will be milestones, but there’s never a finish line.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Daddy, can you run yet? 😊” =&gt; “You can’t beat me! 😛” =&gt; “Daddy, you’re cheating! 😡”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Six months after amputation, Garrett spent two and a half days snowboarding without pain killers. Today, he can comfortably enjoy a full day on the mountain.</p>
<p><strong>It’s about progress—not aspirations.</strong> Focus on how far you’ve come because our journeys never end. You’ll never reach a finish line.</p>
<p>Garrett isn't where he used to be, and he's not quite where he wants to be, but he's getting there every day.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LHRXrUp.jpg" alt="Garrett can't tease his wife about bringing a suitcase worth of shoes anymore when they travel" /></p>
<p>You may put on sunglasses or grab an umbrella. Business and life is no different. We can all be confident our circumstances will change. So when it changes, do what humans do. Find a way to adapt.</p>
<p><strong>We’re all adaptive.</strong> Adaptation is unavoidable, and businesses have to adapt and change too.</p>
<p>What we’re adapting to is different. For some it’s losing a leg. For some it’s having kids. For others it’s a new role at work.</p>
<p>You’re way more adaptive and strong than you realize. You’ve just never had to unleash that strength. It’s there. You just don’t know it yet.</p>
<p>With that, I want to leave you with one thought…</p>

<h1 id="contentmarketingpaidadvertising">Content Marketing + Paid Advertising</h1>
<p>Here's CartHook's campaign from January to March of this year.</p>
<p>CartHook has been slow in adopting content marketing. Paid advertising, contrastingly, has a clear ROI.</p>
<p>So what'd they do? <strong>Content Marketing + Paid Advertising</strong></p>
<p>They took free content, retargeted their audience, and then offered a free trial.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get attention: get some mindshare</li>
<li>Establish credibility: talk about your insight into the market</li>
<li>Your product: in the context of market trends, you've earned the ability to talk about your own product</li>
<li>Build audience</li>
<li>Make offer</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get Attention: CartHook wrote and facebook promoted a "<a href="https://blog.carthook.com/100-million-dollars-lighting-way-look-back-2017/">$100-Million Dollars Lighting the Way (A Look Back at 2017)</a>" blog post.</li>
<li>Establish credibility: "<a href="https://blog.carthook.com/ecommerce-sales-funnels-a-new-trend-for-big-growth/">eCommerce Sales Funnels: A New Trend for Big Growth</a>"</li>
<li>"<a href="https://blog.carthook.com/future-trends-succeed-ecommerce/">Future Trends: What you Need to Know to Succeed in eCommerce in 2018 and Beyond</a>"</li>
<li>Product focus: "<a href="https://blog.carthook.com/optimize-ecommerce-checkout/">How (and Why) to Optimize your eCommerce Checkout Experience</a>"</li>
<li>Killer feature: "<a href="https://blog.carthook.com/art-of-upsells/">The Art of Upsells (Boost Your Order Value While Building Trust)</a>"</li>
<li>Repurpose to eBook: <a href="#">The Advanced Guide to Ecommerce Funnels</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Each post was promoted for 7 days ($4k in ads). Got 127 retargeted free trials, which cost $32/signup.</p>
<p>These signups converted at 30%, which are paying $200/month.</p>
<p><strong>$4k spent to get $136k ARR!</strong></p>

<p>Write and promote: an attention post, a market trend post (what's your unique insight into the market?), write a product post (what does your product…), a killer feature post (what is your differentiating feature that people need in order to succeed?). Then repurpose the content and host a webinar showing real results from someone using your product (promoting and retargeting this too).</p>

<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<p><strong>How much time did you spend on this? How will you repurpose this campaign in the future - what's the 5-year strategy?</strong></p>
<p>It caught us off guard how well it worked - we're not sure. Unless we really nail the next idea it probably won't work as well.</p>
<p><strong>Is retargeting just within facebook?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We also tried retargeting within Google but it didn't work as well.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you promote the pieces serially instead of in parallel?</strong></p>
<p>To capture and build up maximum attention, though we might not do it like this in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Are there other channels over email that are on your radar?</strong></p>

<p>Justin started a showboard shop with two friends in 2003, which was a huge mistake.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bExR2as.jpg" alt="Justin's dream was to start his own snowboard shop" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oW4F5AD.jpg" alt="Justin's snowboard shop opened in 2003 and closed in 2005. At 25, he was $85k in debt" /></p>
<p>He learned a few things.</p>
<h2 id="lesson1choosingtherightcustomerismoreimportantthanwhatyousell">Lesson 1: Choosing the right customer is more important than what you sell.</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WUTvhcG.jpg" alt="This guy's name is &quot;Fauckler.&quot; Does it look like he has any money? Snowboarders are bad customers." /></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HXu1ViU.jpg" alt="The lessons you learn when you start small just get magnified when you go big." /></p>
<p>If Justin had started small, he would've known the Faucklers are bad customers, but with smaller stakes. He could've gotten out for cheaper when he realized he didn't like it.</p>

<h2 id="lesson3thewaywestartbusinessesiswrong">Lesson 3: the way we start businesses is wrong.</h2>
<p>The idea people have behind building businesses is that you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a good idea</li>
<li>Launch it</li>
<li>$$$</li>
</ol>
<p>But this doesn't work! We we evolved it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a good idea</li>
<li>Validate it</li>
<li>Launch it</li>
<li>$$$</li>
</ol>
<p>Even product/market fit isn't enough, though. You need more than that.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You need more than product/market fit. You need market/founder fit, product/market fit, and product/founder fit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is your audience a group of people that you want to serve every day for the rest of your life? Is this product a good fit for what you want? Does it match up with your values? Does it get you where you want to go?</p>

<h1 id="productvalidationroadmap">Product Validation Roadmap 🗺</h1>
<p>Are you at Microconf to find a product idea? Are you trying to choosing a target market? Do you want to validate your product idea? Have you launched, but need more customers? Justin can help.</p>
<p>Here's Justin's step-by-step approach for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying who you are, and what you want</li>
<li>Choosing a market</li>
<li>Discovering what they want</li>
<li>Shipping a (small) initial solution</li>

<h3 id="question1whatsyourmotivationforwantingtobuildaproduct">Question 1: What's your motivation for wanting to build a product?</h3>
<p>People call Justin for coaching all the time trying to get him to validate their idea. "I wanna do arbitrage for cryptocurrency!" - Justin isn't the target market! But he knows you need to figure out <em>why</em> you want to do this.</p>
<p><em>"I want to build a product so that I can _ ."</em></p>
<h3 id="question2whatdoyouvalue">Question 2: What do you value?</h3>
<p>What <a href="https://jamesclear.com/core-values">core values</a> do you have?</p>
<ul>
<li>Creativity</li>
<li>Impact</li>
<li>Integrity</li>
<li>Adventure</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Wealth</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, how wealthy would you like to be?</p>
<ul>
<li>Very wealthy ($1 million+)</li>
<li>Higher than average ($300k / year)</li>
<li>Financially secure ($150k / year)</li>
<li>Basic needs ($50k - $100k / year)</li>

<h2 id="section2chooseyourmarket">Section 2: choose your market</h2>
<p>Who do you want to serve? Start with a group of people you want to help. A great business isn't about you, and your dream. It's about helping your customers achieve their dreams.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A great business isn't about you, and your dream. It's about helping your customers achieve their dreams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few ideas for finding your market:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you currently make a living?</li>
<li>What kind of customers do you serve at work? (these people are already paying for your expertise)</li>
<li>What communities do you belong to?</li>
<li>What do you do better than anyone else?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bBR2vdd.jpg" alt="Ian Landsman's first customers were people he was already serving" /></p>
<p>Factors to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do they spend money?</li>
<li>How big is the market?</li>
<li>How easy are they to reach?</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7cqMPfI.jpg" alt="Björn Forsberg started by building shopify apps - a huge market that spends a lot of money" /></p>
<p>Also consider how easy your audience is to reach.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TBQCh0N.png" alt="Justin got the founder of Balsamiq on a skype call just by asking" /></p>
<p>Questions to ask in an interview (for B2B):</p>
<ol>
<li>What's your focus right now at work? What are you looking to improve?</li>
<li>What's something you'd like to accomplish, but can't? What's holding you back?</li>
<li>What was the last product, service, or tool you bought for work?</li>
<li>What's your least favorite tool you have to use right now?</li>
<li>What kinds of tasks are you currently doing in Excel?</li>
<li>What product do you wish existed (but doesn't yet)?</li>
</ol>
<p>What trends are you seeing in the community? Right now in the Microconf community, GDPR is a hot topic.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/b55BAEG.png" alt="GDPR hate is trendy in Microconf" /></p>
<p>Summarize your research</p>

<li>What patterns emerged?</li>
<li>What would say are the #1 and #2 things your market is struggling with?</li>
<li>What would it mean for them if you solved that struggle? We're solving problems for real human beings!</li>

<p>Podcasting example</p>
<p>Many tech businesses want <code>a branded podcast</code>, but struggle with <code>getting listeners</code>.
I can help them by:</p>
<ul>
<li>improving their show art + description</li>
<li>getting them more ratings + reviews</li>
<li>making their episodes easier to share</li>

  <p>When you ask your audience “would you buy this”, many may say they will, but when it comes time to pay they don’t.

<p>Ask questions like "what was the last product you bought from work?"</p>

<p>Other trends to look for (especially in a client's slack):</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your target market investing in? (ex: ReWork podcast is a huge investment from basecamp)</li>
<li>What's getting a lot of publicity right now?</li>
<li>What are people struggling with?</li>

<p>Start with a small free offering. If that works, move to a small paid offering. If that works. build a simple product. If that works, put more features in and charge more.</p>

<h3 id="transistorfmcasestudy">Transistor.fm case study</h3>
<p>Here's how this has worked so far for Transistor.fm.</p>
<p>Justin started with some small free offerings of podcasts:</p>
<ul>
<li>ProductPeople.tv</li>
<li>MegaMaker</li>
<li>Build Your SaaS</li>
</ul>
<p>In the process, he noticed some trends. 75% of people who bought Marketing for Devs, were podcast listeners, and made a huge effort to come talk to him because they felt like they'd known him for years (<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/coffee/">"If you make it to Vernon, BC, I'll buy you coffee"</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6IWKaUe.png" alt="Transistor.fm stair stepper case study" /></p>
<p>Justin also noticed a trend of tech businesses launching podcasts: StartUp by Gimlet, CodePen Radio, and others.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"64.35% of my customers came from hearing me on a
  podcast." -Brian Casel</p>

<p>John works for Cards Against Humanity, so Cards Against Humanity was Transistor.fm's first client in starting <a href="http://www.thegoodnewspodcast.fm/">The Good News Podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Google is now transcribing and scraping Audio content - that's a huge positive sign in the trend of podcasting.</p>

<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Who's your favorite American podcaster?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://avclark.com/">Adam Clark</a>, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>If you're already two months in with 6-10 customers, is it worth going back and building the audience?</strong></p>
<p>I think it is - there's so much pain if you don't figure out the personal questions of what you want, value, and how much money you want to make. If it keeps growing and doesn't match your values you'll end up in a lot of pain.</p>
<p>Don't get stuck making gambling machines in India.</p>
<p><strong>Is B2C SaaS always a bad idea?</strong></p>
<p>Ugh. Yes, but there's definitely people that make it work.</p>
<p>SaaS B2C businesses are things people desire: Netflix, Spotify, etc. It's hard to deliver that if you're a bootstrapper.</p>
<p>Prosumers are different - that sometimes works.</p>
<p><strong>Do you consider parameters for failures?</strong></p>
<p>I have much better parameters for success now. Ex: if I can't get 500 people on a mailing list, it's probably not going to work.</p><h1>An Unconventional Way to Validate Your Product Idea</h1><iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin" security="restricted" src="https://lan.io/blog/podcast/justin-mares/embed/" width="100%" height="700" title="Rob Walling Recap Interview - Lanio" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" class="wp-embedded-content"></iframe>

<h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>
<p>Former director of revenue, Exceptional Software (acquired by Rackspace for $10M). Currently director of <a href="https://usefomo.com">Fomo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fomohttpsusefomocom"><a href="https://usefomo.com">Fomo</a></h2>
<p>Social proof app that boosts conversion rates (ex: "your friend just bought this thing!"). Used to be a shopify app ("notify") doing 18k MRR, then Justin and his brother bought it with seller financing (ask him about this!).</p>
<p>Justin saw a massive conversion boost (20%) by implementing Fomo on his other site, <a href="https://www.kettleandfire.com/">Kettle and Fire</a>.</p>
<h2 id="first18monthsto4x">First 18 months to 4x</h2>
<p>Here's what Justin did to grow Fomo 4x in 18 months.</p>
<h3 id="day1raiseprices">Day 1: Raise Prices</h3>
<p>So many people still don't do this. They feel like they want to give their customers a good deal, and raising prices cheats their customers.</p>
<p>Justin raised the bottom tier from $14.99/month to $29/month, and added multiple tiers up to $199/month. Now he could capture the value of higher value customers.</p>
<p>After raising prices, they saw basically no difference in conversions. Raising the prices just got rid of "kicking the tires" bad customers.</p>
<h3 id="day2optimizetheshopifylisting">Day 2: Optimize the shopify listing</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>What can we do to increase the likelihood that someone signs up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shamelessly ask for reviews! "If you like notify, could you take 30 seconds to help me grow my little business? If you have any feature ideas, let me know! We're adding features over the next few months"</p>
<p>This catapulted Fomo to the top of Shopify ratings with 50 new reviews. Shopify is also excited about sharing Fomo. Also <a href="https://www.capterra.com/">Capterra</a>.</p>
<h3 id="day3churn">Day 3: Churn</h3>
<p>Started with churn of 1-19%. If their app got delisted, they'd be out of business in 5 months!</p>
<p>How'd they decrease churn? Lots of no-brainers: show your customers that by using your product, they make more money. Fomo did it with <a href="https://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> automatic emails.</p>
<p>They also initiated as many one-on-one emails as they could. Five days after signing up, customers get an email <code>Intro: ${customer_name} &lt;&gt; ${customer_support}</code> from the CEO.</p>
<p>Also, hire! Hire enough people to decrease customer support response time. They also get a much better pulse of what customers want.</p>
<p>At day 90, churn was down from 19% to under 8%.</p>
<h3 id="integrations">Integrations</h3>
<p>Fomo invested in building integrations, like a line of Javascript to integrate with with BigCommerce (which cost $1,500). In the first 45 days this integration was live, it made $1,000 (now at ~$8k/month).</p>
<p>After doing more integrations, Shopify went from 100% of business to under 40%.</p>
<p>Today Fomo has over 50 integrations.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CrhrxCk.png" alt="FOMO has over 50 integrations" /></p>
<p>Fomo now buys smaller businesses (like <a href="https://www.builtwithshopify.com/">Built with Shopify</a>, ~30k uniques/month), which is like cheating at integrations.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>4x the business! From ~$25k MRR to $100k MRR this month.</p>

<h2 id="qa">Q/A</h2>
<p><strong>How did you decide to hire 3 full time service reps? Did you look at alternatives?</strong></p>
<p>We didn't do it from day 1. Our first hire was a customer support person, and they had a positive ROI by preventing churning and upselling. They paid for themself 100x over.</p>
<p><strong>Did you hire any software developers?</strong></p>
<p>Justin's cofounder did most of the development, then hired out development to a dev shop investing the founders' money.</p>
<p><strong>How did you approach the competitors that you acquired?</strong></p>
<p>On day 1, we emailed all 20 of our competitors and asked if they were open at all. More than half said they were interested in selling, integrating, and walking away.</p>
<p><strong>Re: raise prices, how did you come to that magic number? How did you know you weren't pricing too high?</strong></p>
<p>I still don't know we're at the magic number! We tested it and it worked well. We split tested sending special offers to existing customers (<code>upgrade now for ${price}!</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Did you grandfather existing customers?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, for a year.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have negotiation tips for negotiation integrations?</strong></p>
<p>Have something in it for your integration partner! Promote them.</p>
<p><strong>How are you differentiating yourself from your competitors?</strong></p>
<p>One of our biggest competitors just went through YCombinator. There's not a ton we can do with feature differentiation - it's a rat race. What we focus on is the actual experience of using the product. If you have two matching products, integrations and customer support and scaling and the overall smoothness of the experience is what makes the difference.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you have two matching products, you'll choose the one with a better overall experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The overall market is bigger with competitors, which actually works to our advantage.</p>
<p><strong>How did you connect with Zapier?</strong></p>
<p>We cold emailed their partner integration partner person. It was pretty easy for us.</p>
<p><strong>Other than Zapier, do you have an API?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/api/fomo">Yes</a> - it's been a big win for our larger customers.</p>
<p><strong>How do you source and onboard a support team?</strong></p>
<p>We hire support from development bootcamps. Dev bootcamps don't make you a strong, facebook-level engineer, so they're having trouble finding work. We put them through the customer support training we care about and another $25k/month technical course</p>
<p>"You're not good enough to code for real yet, so come here and do customer support and we'll invest in you. After a year you can either get onboarded as an engineer or move on."</p><h1>&quot;How We've Taken Fomo 20 -> 80K MRR in 18 Months&quot;</h1><iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin" security="restricted" src="https://lan.io/blog/podcast/lianna-patch/embed/" width="100%" height="700" title="Rob Walling Recap Interview - Lanio" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" class="wp-embedded-content"></iframe>

<p>There are so many principles of improv and humor that can help you shape marketing copy, connect with your users, built loyalty, and increase retention.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>My parents have managed to miss all my shows :(</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your SaaS isn't using humor, you aren't getting the results you deserve. You could be connecting more genuinely with your users.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5N8VOFt.jpg" alt="Comedy Reading List" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RUTKl38.png" alt="If your SaaS isn't using humor, you aren't getting the results you deserve. You could be connecting more genuinely with your users." /></p>
<p>Funny copy can be <em>longer</em> and <em>convert better</em>. There's a strong connection between humor and money.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There's a strong connection between humor and money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"Ok yeah but my software isn't funny"</em> - is it less funny than <a href="https://www.mapistry.com/">stormwater compliance software</a>?</p>
<h2 id="1whyhumoraffectsus">1. WHY humor affects us</h2>
<p>Why is humor sometimes uncomfortable? It <strong>makes us vulnerable</strong>. Past experiences of offending people make us wary, and we feel like work should be serious.</p>
<p>Humor has huge advantages though. It activates parts of the brain associated with happiness and fulfillment that make us more receptive.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XSirBZe.png" alt="Don't make your user feel like your product is a taskmaster - nobody wants to do work" /></p>
<p>Even when your campaign is delivering bad news (like prices )</p>
<h3 id="humortopics">Humor topics</h3>
<p><em>What is a joke I don't understand teach me</em> - you probably if you're German</p>
<p>Pick your humor topic by asking your users what they like (movies, books, standup comedians, dank memes, etc.)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IaSyp1c.jpg" alt="How do you know what your users will find funny? Literally ask them." /></p>
<p>Once you know what your users think is funny, humor topics are anything both you and your users think are funny.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ku6gVNA.png" alt="Humor topics are anything both you and your users think are funny" /></p>
<h3 id="humorstyle">Humor Style</h3>
<p>Generally, humor can be either <strong>observational</strong> or <strong>self-deprecating</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uIC8w5q.png" alt="Observational humor in SaaS" /></p>
<p>Self-deprecating humor is making fun of yourself or your product. You're the butt of the joke, so the risk of offending is low.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3kIKHFH.png" alt="Self-deprecating humor in SaaS" /></p>
<h2 id="2wheretousehumortobesteffect">2. WHERE to use humor to best effect</h2>
<p>Don't use humor in your value proposition (the quick line or two of text explaining what it is you do and why your users should care). This could muddy your value proposition and lose your customer quickly.</p>
<p>If you're sending traffic to landing pages, it's okay to crack a joke because you know more about your users. Surprising humor can keep your user reading.</p>
<p>Humor also works very well in emails and in your app experience (ex: instead of just "date range", "date range be like" from FOMO has more personality).</p>
<h2 id="3howtopunchupyourcopylinebyline">3. HOW to punch up your copy line by line</h2>
<p>There are three types of comedy punchups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Show your emotions</li>
<li>Piss off your grammar teacher</li>
<li>Lead the way</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1showyouremotions">1. Show your emotions</h3>
<p>Writing in ALL CAPS (sparingly, so you don't seem like an old person trying to use the internet) is a great way to show emotion in copy.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uP2QtVB.png" alt="Rockin' Green showin' emotion" /></p>
<p>Comic book words - tangible action words - breath emotion into your copy</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AJHG2EP.jpg" alt="ZAPPIN some action words your way" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CzqSj4v.png" alt="Comic book words in SaaS copy shows emotion" /></p>
<p>Making asides is another great way to humanize your copy.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/u22ZFOc.png" alt="Making asides in SaaS copy shows emotion" /></p>
<p>Gifs can be great, but use them sparingly. If they're too long, referencing jokes your users won't get, or irrelevent to their context they won't work well.</p>
<h3 id="2pissoffyourgrammarteacherpoygt">2. Piss Off Your Grammar Teacher (POYGT)</h3>
<p>Using unconventional grammar can increase conversions:</p>
<ul>
<li>adsf</li>
<li>Including a typo in your subject line (like "moar")</li>
<li>using contractions and abbreviations (now "Hot is it going (fellow kids)", but "so I wanna know", "gonna", etc.)</li>
<li>chop up your sentences</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kitKfXY.png" alt="Humanizing friendly abbreviations to use in copy" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vKXKLMM.png" alt="Chop up your sentences" /></p>
<h3 id="3leadtheway">3. Lead the Way</h3>
<p>Ask and answer questions to get right to what your user is thinking.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nqa34fk.jpg" alt="Lead the way by anticipating your user's questions" /></p>
<p>You can also try trailing off with ellipsis…</p>
<p>…and including a call to action! "Upgrade my Bear!" is a great CTA, "take a look inside" isn't.</p>

<p><strong>Hi, I'm in the funeral niche…</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OXuMFuJ.gif" alt="&quot;Hi, I'm in the funeral niche…&quot;" /></p>
<p><strong>…does it really work across all industries?</strong></p>
<p>Results may vary. It's totally possible though. You know your target client: if they're cool with death, it could totally work.</p>
<p><strong>Do you know a type of humor that can work across age demographics?</strong></p>
<p>Start with research into what your audience thinks is funny! Now that you know misspellings don't work on older people but do on younger people, you can tailor your humor accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Does B2B vs. B2C matter?</strong></p>
<p>B2C has gone whole-hog with humor. Would you rather have a president that can crack a joke about himself, or one that can't take a joke?</p>
<p><strong>How do you ask people what they think is funny?</strong></p>
<p>It's random and surprises people. Sandwich it between other user research. Ask two questions with data you really need to know, then reward them with a question about what they think is funny.</p>
<p><strong>We used to have a gif of Arnold lifting weights but it was cats instead of weights, and most people found it funny but some called us animal abusers. What do you do with those kind of reactions?</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jxaAK9m.gif" alt="Apparently some people find this offensive" /></p>
<p>Ask who your ideal user is - what's the lifetime value of someone who likes the gif vs. those who don't? Focus on people who are worth it to you.</p>
<p><strong>How do we test what's offensive? Are there baby steps if you're in a sensitive, serious industry like public safety?</strong></p>
<p>Integrate humor slowly and cautiously. Test a version of <em>a</em> joke in <em>one</em> email.</p><h1>undefined</h1><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.facebook.com%2Fteamlanio%2Fvideos%2F1679392802109343%2F&show_text=0&width=560" width="560" height="315" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>

<p>Here's Marie's master class of what not to do. It's a very honest behind the scenes of what's happened since Oki Doki launched, and their journey to sustainability.</p>

<li>How we launched our idea(s)</li>
<li>what we got wrong (and right)</li>
<li>What permaculture can teach us</li>
<li>What it means for you</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="1howmarieandbenlaunchedtheirideas">1. How Marie and Ben Launched their Idea(s)</h1>
<p>Ben and Marie didn't start with any customer research or audience building, but they did get $10k for their first Digital Strategy School. The beta later made $50k.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FwxXTuX.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="1observeinteract">1. Observe &amp; Interact</h2>
<p>Pay attention to the patterns.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QcLNVZ9.jpg" alt="Observing and Interacting to and with your environment is a basic tenant of permaculture. You're spending up to a year just observing your land before making any major decisions." /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3yTL0Bo.jpg" alt="Observing and Interacting to and with your environment is a basic tenant of SaaS, as in Permaculture" /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We didn't do enough research. This is really something I wish I'd understood before we started building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marie and Ben could've learned a lot from 10 or 20 customer interviews before touching a line of code.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LebjYzk.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RmHX1pX.png" alt="Oki Doki's path skipped the necessary permaculture lessons" /></p>
<h2 id="2usersmallandslowsolutions">2. User Small and Slow Solutions</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RmHX1pX.png" alt="You can't start with a tropical oasis - just start with the smallest little piece. In permaculture, a raised garden bed is a great small start" /></p>
<p>Oki Doki made several mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New endeavour</li>
<li>New technology</li>
<li>Complex functionality Multi-layers of user permissions New (to us) market</li>
<li>Very competitive space Committed before any revenue Over-engineered for growth</li>
</ul>
<p>They should have started small:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interview 20 people</li>
<li>Design prototypes</li>
<li>Landing page with signups Blog posts</li>
<li>Office hours Consultations</li>
</ul>
<p>They did our first demo once the product was already built to scale - <strong>don't do this!!!</strong> Bring in someone at the rough and ready state to play with it. Observe them to see how they're using it. Product demos - just watching someone using their tool - are very humbling. Things you think are intuitive aren't. You are not your audience.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Product demos - just watching someone using their tool - are very humbling. Things you think are intuitive aren't.</p>

<p>They built it in secret - <strong>don't do this either!!!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Oh, I had no idea you had a platform - I already signed up for a competitor!" - "friend"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We were letting our competitors lead our innovation (instead of our customers). Your customers have the most to teach you.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Embrace small, imperfect progress. Your customers have the most to teach you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What should you do? Tell people what you're working on and be in conversation constantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share early concepts</li>
<li>Don’t wait until your product is polished to share it</li>
<li>Do things right the first time</li>
<li>Be honest about your limitations</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qJDXlpL.png" alt="When Marie went to Microconf for the first time in 2016, she had her mind blown by all these new concepts: churn, MRR, CAC - she realized she had a lot to learn" /></p>
<p>Even with these mistakes, they managed to get to $1k MRR.</p>
<h2 id="3designfrompatternstodetails">3. Design from patterns to details</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TZRuJN7.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Don't focus on the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical stack</li>
<li>Specific Features</li>
<li>Create a course</li>
<li>Sell a course</li>
<li>Deliver a course</li>
</ul>
<p>Focus on the patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diversify offers</li>
<li>"how do I turn my 1:1 into training?"</li>
<li>Bundle offers</li>
<li>Services onboarding</li>
<li>Mentorship</li>
<li>Guided course experiences</li>
<li>Course fatigue</li>
<li>Imposter Complex</li>
<li>Procrastination</li>
</ul>
<p>We were so focused on the details of execution that we were missing out on the larger patterns of behaviour.</p>
<p>Our ideal customers were entrepreneurs who had high-touch coaching programs.</p>
<p>Our customers kept extending their trial because their courses were taking them way longer to build than they expected.</p>
<p>To zoom out and make sure you're not getting caught up in the details, ask "how might we".</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4IZ2AjZ.png" alt="Ask real questions that solve your audience's problems, not &quot;how might we build a course platform and help sell people sell their courses?&quot;" /></p>
<p>Design generally before specifically; Understand the underlying patterns</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask “How might we?” questions</li>
<li>ZOOM OUT: Understand the problem from all angles</li>
<li>Understand the emotional context surrounding the problem</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6biDh0D.png" alt="Marie and Ben realized they needed to integrate more of their efforts" /></p>

How we make things easier?</p>

<p>Marie then:</p>

<li>Hired Instructional Designer</li>
<li>Put Digital Strategy School on hold</li>
<li>Did Deeper Customer Research</li>
<li>Introduced Course Consulting</li>
<li>Shifted Company Positioning</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Why do you hate making money?" -Ben</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They went back to what we knew how to do best: working with clients 1:1. That meant noticing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spending way too long building courses and programs before validating the idea</li>
<li>People were signing up for a platform long before they had content ready to go (then procrastinating)</li>
<li>Amateur course creators were fire-hosing their learners with too much information</li>
<li>New(ish) product creators were expecting their first courses to replace their client income</li>

<p>We finally had an integrated product / service / SaaS ecosystem.</p>
<p>What now? On-demand demos have become a lead generation tool for our services.</p>
<p>Elements should work collectively toward a stronger whole:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage existing skills + assets</li>
<li>Think holistically</li>
<li>Integrate services into your SaaS</li>
<li>“Many hands make light work”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5creativelyuseandrespondtochange">5. Creatively use and respond to change</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7PcKtgx.jpg" alt="The problem is the solution" /></p>
<p>We had to adapt in a way that made sense for the way we work with people.</p>
<p>We knew we didn’t want to be the “build your 6-figure passive income course” people.</p>
<p>2 years of working with course creators and coaches finally gave us the insights we were looking for.</p>
<p>We stopped worrying about what our competitors were doing, and focused on what our customers needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xNsrrqZ.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Hw2TWtA.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>What happened? Everything became easier. Better copy creates resonance, which helps you stay competitive.</p>
<p>“When life gives you lemons, make lemonade”;
Turn change into opportunity</p>

<li>Change is inevitable</li>
<li>Problems are opportunities</li>
<li>Listen to your customers over your competitors</li>
<li>Find your unique edge</li>

<p>Permaculture principles:</p>

</ul>
<p>It took OKI DOKI 3 years to find our groove + become sustainable. Is your SaaS part of your business, or is it your business?</p>
<p>Why would we hustle so damn hard… for a life we already have? Once we let go of the “shoulds” and the FOMO, we realized that we could make a great living as a small company, and love our life.</p>

<h2 id="1knowwhatyouarelookingfor">1. Know What You Are Looking For</h2>
<p>Put a lot of work into the job description. Make sure you're answering:</p>

<li>What culture are you creating?</li>
<li>What will the person do?</li>
<li>Why should they work for you?</li>
</ol>
<p>Be as transparent as possible. If you're hiring a sales manager, let them know 60% of their time will be working on inbound leads and emails, but 30% of your time should be on outbound things, and 10% will definitely be on random stuff because we're a small company.</p>

<p>To hire better (and not step on the banana peal trap of hiring):</p>
<ol>
<li>Be clear about the job</li>
<li>Don't be desperate</li>
<li>Make sure they have the right skills</li>

<p>This method isn't conclusive - it's only been used by 9 people with a 15-40% success rate. It's worth taking a look.</p>
<h2 id="1similarities">1. Similarities</h2>

<p>Good: I’ve spoken with Person X and Person Y about ExampleCo, and they both raved about how willing the company is to invest in employee’s growth.</p>
<p>Bad: ExampleCo has a great culture.</p>
<h2 id="4rightconversation">4. Right conversation</h2>
<p>Come in with specific questions, not open ended.</p>
<p>Good: I think the most important next steps for my business are X, Y, Z. I’d like to see if you agree, and talk about some strategy for X because you’ve used that tactic extensively in the past.</p>
<p>Bad: I want to learn more about your experience.</p>
<h2 id="5offertohelpoptional">5. Offer to help (optional)</h2>
<p>Good: It looks like your design team does a lot of user testing. Would it help if I was a tester in your next UX experiment?</p>
<p>Bad: I’d be happy to help if I can.</p>
<p>Bad: I'd love to help however I can.</p>

<li>give the perception that you're busy. "I can do any time Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Please please please call me." is bad</li>
</ul>
<p>Good: I can jump into a 15 minute phone conversation (all times PST) Thursday between 3PM and 7PM, Saturday between 2PM and 8PM, or Monday between 8AM and 11AM.</p>
<p>Calls or video conferences are less commitment and easier to say yes to. More commitment drinks or dinner is harder to say yes to but can create a stronger bond.</p>

<p>Mike is behind Startups for the Rest of Us, the Single Founder Handbook, Microconf, and (most recently) bluetick.io</p>
<p>Clarification: <strong>follow up email != cold email</strong></p>
<h1 id="2whyfollowup">2. Why Follow Up</h1>
<p>There are four things you want to know when following up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Was it received?</li>
<li>Did they understand it?</li>
<li>Did they make a decision?</li>
<li>Did they inform you of that decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're not answering these questions, your email is getting sent into the void - the email black hole.</p>
<h1 id="3whathappensontheotherend">3. What happens on the Other End</h1>
<p>There are four reasons why people don't reply to emails, even if it's important to the recipient:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>They never received it</strong>. Either mail server issues (surprisingly common), the wrong email address, it was filtered as spam, or the person is out of the office/vacationing/traveling.</li>
<li><strong>Received, but dismissed</strong>. Either email filters or rules, irrelevant subject line, they skimmed the email and made the wrong decision, a gatekeeper rejected it (like if someone isn't managing their own mailbox), or they were scarred off because of a wall of text.</li>
<li><strong>Received with best of intentions</strong>. Either they're traveling, working remotely, on a mobile device, their mailbox is flooded, they've declared email bankruptcy, the email has dropped off their radar, something is on fire, or there's guilt from not responding sooner. Followups give them permission to reply.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="4whydontwefollowup">4. Why don't we follow up?</h1>
<p>Why don't we follow up?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Incorrect value association</strong>. Value is a measurement of what the email does for the recipient, and what a response means to the sender? If the value of a response doesn't feel measurable,</li>
<li><strong>Time constraints</strong>. Either it feels like busy-work, or because… deadlines.</li>
<li><strong>Your emotions will get the better of you</strong>. Sending follow up emails is emotionally painful. You feel like you're repeating yourself and negative emotions are disproportionally outweighing the positive ones.</li>
<li><strong>We're afraid</strong>.</li>

<p>Open rate of 26.7% is actually the worst open rate on Bluetick. Several are getting close to 100%!</p>
<p>Reply rate average is 5.9% - the best is close to 30%! The way to close that reply loop is to just send more emails.</p>
<p>What percent of people are blocking tracking pixels in email? Depends on your audience - it ranges from 0% to 62.5%.</p>
<h2 id="thefourpillarsoffollowupsuccess">The Four Pillars of Followup Success</h2>
<ol>
<li>When: select the situations where it makes sense and the schedule to follow up. After first contact and after a demo work well.</li>
<li>Personalization: Use their name, use your own domain, reply to previous emails you send, etc.</li>
<li>Action: clearly define the single action you want the person to take</li>
<li>Automation: templates, software, reminders, Zapier, outsourcing, etc, done in a way that doesn't appear to be automated</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0wZ8iTU.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you get into personalization, you have to be really careful. Don't send an email that starts "Hi ,", or "Hi FNAME".</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1IX1UTg.jpg" alt="Don't send a personalized email to &quot;Hi ,&quot;, &quot;Hi $FNAME&quot;, or &quot;Vagina&quot;" /></p>

<p><strong>How do you send breakup emails?</strong></p>
<p>Typical breakup email says "hey I've sent you several emails, I can see you're not interested, so I'll never email you again". This closes the door to emailing them in the future. A better reply is "hey, I can see this isn't a good time for you. I'll followup again in 6 weeks."</p>
<p><strong>I'm worried about an automated system following up when I've already followed up in a different way. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>If your call to action doesn't apply if you've had another interaction (ex: "let's schedule a call" when you've already had a call), you should trigger those manually. Once the illusion of personal responses has been destroyed, your response rates go way down.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Do you legally have to have an "unsubscribe" link in automated emails? Is that a tell?</strong></p>
<p>It's toeing the line either way. Even if you have an unsubscribe link, you can still be breaking the law. Bluetick doesn't include them.</p>
<p>There are three legal categories of email:</p>
<ol>
<li>transactional</li>
<li>commercial (where CANN spam laws come into play)</li>
<li>other (good job naming this one, government)</li>
</ol>
<p>Most email providers make you include an unsubscribe link so their entire server doesn't get blacklisted, not for legal reasons.</p>

<h1 id="facebooksads">Facebooks Ads</h1>
<h2 id="whyarentyoudoingfacebookads">Why aren't you doing facebook ads?</h2>
<p>Common reasons not to do facebook ads are:</p>
<ul>
<li>complicated</li>
<li>time-consuming</li>
<li>expensive: I spent $1k and nothing happened!</li>
<li>don't know where to start</li>
</ul>
<p>These are excuses - throw them out and let's talk strategy.</p>
<p>It used to be super hard to get in front of people. Now you can get in front of people for $10 - take advantage of the new technology!</p>
<h2 id="whymostfacebookadvertisingcampaignsfail">Why Most Facebook Advertising Campaigns Fail</h2>
<p>Usually, facebook campaigns fail from:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Selling to cold audiences directly</strong>: you wouldn't knock on a stranger's door and ask to sell them a $50 ebook - they wouldn't trust you! You haven't built any authority. This is a bad idea.</li>
<li><strong>Wanting to close the deal too quickly</strong>: someone that has visited your homepage isn't a customer prospect. You need to build up more trust first.</li>
<li><strong>Optimizing for the wrong metrics</strong>: you probably don't want to optimize for clicks.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/F7HKRBU.png" alt="Before you launch your first campaign (even if you don't plan to advertise on facebook soon), spend two minutes implementing the Facebook Pixel - a code that lets you track your audience's behavior" /></p>

<h2 id="facebookadvertisingfunnel">Facebook advertising Funnel</h2>
<p>A typical facebook ad funnel looks like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attract visitors</li>
<li>Generate leads</li>
<li>Close sales</li>
</ol>
<p>For each layer, define:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is the <strong>goal</strong> of this campaign? what do I want to achieve?</li>
<li>what is the <strong>asset</strong> I want to promote?</li>
<li>who is the <strong>audience</strong> I want to reach?</li>
<li>what's the <strong>approach</strong> that I need to take to achieve that goal?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1attractvisiitors">1. Attract Visiitors</h2>
<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<ul>

<li>Build trust and establish authority.</li>
<li>Facebook pixel tag so you can collect people in an audience and retarget them later.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asset">Asset</h3>
<p>Something your audience can implement theirselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>Valuable blog posts.</li>
<li>Video content. Facebook is really strong on video. You don't need professional gear - videos taken with your phone in 5 minutes are fine. Talk about something valuable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't know what to promote? Look at your popular blog posts.</p>
<h3 id="coldaudience">(cold) Audience</h3>
<p>There are two approaches you can take:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Targeting</strong>: target people based on what they like. You can target competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Lookalike Audiences</strong>: upload your existing customer email list and facebook finds more people similar to that audience with AI magic 😲🧙‍</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note from Christian: advertisers are the true customer of facebook. It's a fantastic service</em></p>

<h3 id="approach-2">approach</h3>
<ul>
<li>Creative: Focus on specific buyer persona. CEOs of construction companies? Talk specifically to them. Service business providers? Talk specifically to them.</li>
<li>Communicate specific value proposition. What will they get out of this?</li>
<li>Social proof &amp; Testimonials</li>

<p><strong>Facebook cuts long copy off at 2 lines. Is it worth it? Your images also had a lot of text, which facebook doesn't like</strong></p>
<p>I know it sounds weird, but people read long copy. We did hundreds of A/B tests between long and short form copy. <strong>Long form performed way better than short form copy every single time</strong>. Test it yourself.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Stripe is a big company - how do they fit into Microconf? They embody the bootstraper ethos - they took it a long way as two dudes in a garage with minimal funding.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For several months, John slept in the garden of our one bedroom apartment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Today at Microconf you launched <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/llc-vs-c-corp">LLCs on Atlas</a> - congrats!</strong></p>
<p>For a while, the top feature request of <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Atlas</a> has been to support LLCs (a relatively new invention).</p>
<p>We want Atlas to work well for companies that are going to do well, and not a lot of huge companies are LLCs, but early on in a company you don't know what's going to happen. C-corps have a lot of overhead.</p>
<p>LLCs have a lot of options, so fit the ethos of the bootstrapper community better.</p>
<p><strong>You've launched <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a>, now <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/llc-vs-c-corp">Stripe LLC</a>, the Software engineering magazine <a href="https://increment.com/">Increment</a>, and acquired <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indie Hackers</a>. These seem as an outsider like random things - can you comment on the overall umbrella of these?</strong></p>
<p>So many times in building Stripe, some stupid little speedbump almost stopped it from happening. Our thinking of building Stripe is to increase the number of internet businesses.</p>
<p>What determins the number of internet businesses in the world? Why is it that number instead of half that many or twice as many?</p>
<p>As far as we can tell, it's just a lot of these smaller roadbumps.</p>
<p>We're very inspired in the things Indie Hackers et. al are doing because we think it's making it easier to start businesses.</p>
<p>60% of customers on Atlas said they wouldn't have started their business if Atlas didn't exist, so we're continuing to look for opportunities like that.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You don't need to be Mark Zuckerberg to do something incredibly meaningful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a prevailing Ayn Randian idea of entrepreneurs as lone committed furrowplower, whereas the reality is that the community of people around you that understand your problems is underrated.</p>
<p><strong>Word of mouth of Stripe spread fast. Was that a deliberate decision on your and <a href="https://twitter.com/collision">John</a>'s part, or did it just happen because you had a great product?</strong></p>
<p>We lucked out. The things we were competing against were comically bad. Our competitors forced you to fax things to them.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Our competitors were like comic book villains - our competitors forced you to fax things to them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The banking industry when we started was a lot like the healthcare industry is right now. We all roll our eyes at the current solutions knowing that someone is going to come along and roll over the existing market with a much better product.</p>
<p>There's a thing that happens to people writing in a corporate voice - they start talking about synnergy and use a whole other vocabulary. We tried to avoid that at Stripe. Expressing yourself honestly isn't something you can generalize, and it lands with people.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any other marketing channels you've explored that have worked well?</strong></p>
<p>We don't have a great track record with names (Stripe was almost paydaemon or <code>/dev/payments</code>).</p>
<p>Most users discovered Stripe through our integrations with other products, and those integrations were possible because we had great APIs. We think our expertise is in making APIs (and definitely not naming things).</p>

<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<p><strong>You've talked about very small customers on Stripe Atlas and sophisticated customers - how do you build your product so the new people aren't overwhelmed but the huge customers are still getting what they want?</strong></p>
<p>That's <strong>the</strong> core challenge of Stripe. Every feature you add makes the product worse for people who don't use that feature.</p>
<p>Stripe should be able to scale through every order of magnitude - from your first to your ten-millionth payment.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the right strategy is to go serve the customer at every scale, but how do you do that?</p>
<p>There are several torturous tactics we use, like partitioning features, using dynamic documentation that just shows you what we think you care about, slowly rolling out features, and using dynamic dashboards that only show you certain things in the sidebar.</p>
<p>We don't yet have a grand unified theory of how to scale like this - it's becoming an increasingly active discussion.</p>
<p><strong>How much of your success do you attribute to being in Silicon Valley? Could you have had the same success outside of Silicon Valley?</strong></p>
<p>Because we're serving technology companies, we're in a unique position of needing to be around other technology companies.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I think a smaller fraction of the world's best engineers are outside Silicon Valley now than in the last four years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it's less worthwhile to be in Silicon Valley now than in the last four years. One reason for this is that the cost of living is too high. Collaboration tools are also shifting the calculus towards distributed teams working better than they used to.</p>
<p>There are also top tier developers all over the world.</p>
<p>In the next twenty years, we're probably going to see less successful technology companies in Silicon Valley and more around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Do you support open source projects out of goodwill, or are you getting an ROI from it?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of things in the world aren't measurable but still have huge benefits.</p>
<p>At Stripe, we believe in improving open source software and projects like Indie Hackers even though we can't measure the ROI - it just feels important to us. Open source software isn't taken seriously enough by companies benefiting from it.</p>
<p><strong>How'd you deal with financial regulation?</strong></p>
<p>It was very difficult to convince a bank to partner with us - most of them were like 🙅‍.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We were like three squirrels in a trenchcoat masquerading as a real business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's nothing special about us, though - we were just two guys from Ireland with no connections. Anyone could do this.</p>
<p><strong>Fraud and chargebacks suck - how are you guys thinking about that?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If your chargebacks give you heartburn, imagine seeing all of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's net good that they exist because it gives consumers confidence to give a rando business their credentials to charge them. It's a great extension of trust that customers have this recourse.</p>
<p>There are fewer disputes per charge than there ever have been in the past - we think we'll get substantially better still over the next 12 months. Ultimately, though, there's something unsolvable there. It does need to remain easy for consumers to dispute a purchase. What interests me is if structurally we can move beyond that, but it's a complex ecosystem to shepherd.</p>

<p>Don't get caught up in the silicon valley mentality. What are you going to do over the next 40 years?</p>
<h2 id="decisionmakingoverthelonghaul">Decision making over the long haul:</h2>
<ul>
<li>make more small bets. Very little of what you do in business are "trapdoor" (irreversable) decisions.</li>
<li>decide quickly on reversible things that don't matter in the long run. Don't agonize about if you've hit perfection, just get it out the door.</li>
<li>do things which still matter in 40 years. You have a sharply limited amount of time as an entrepreneur - do things that will matter years from now. Write about topics that will still matter in 20 years.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Don't agonize about hitting perfection, just get it out the door.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="grindingduh">Grinding, duh</h2>
<p>You don't need the long term perfect grand strategy, or being an expert, or know what you're doing: you need to go out there every day doing repetitive things that generate small amounts of value, and you need to do it a lot over a long amount of time.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="whatshouldibuild">What should I build?</h2>
<p>"What should I build" is the wrong question to ask first. Ask instead "who should I serve?"</p>
<p>What communities do you feel a calling towards? This is going to be a part of your life for the next several years, so the audience you pick will have a huge impact on your quality of life.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Are you going to bounce up every morning with enthusiasm at talking to dental offices?" - "oh god no!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pick people…</p>
<ul>
<li>…who you're energized in talking to</li>
<li>…whose problems are tractable (ie: not "fight global poverty!")</li>
<li>…with money (serve people who can afford to pay for solutions)</li>
</ul>
<p>Patrick bounces with enthusiasm talking to Microconf people! He had a business talking to teachers for 6 years and got really tired talking to them. Find the people you don't get tired talking to.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Find the people you don't get tired talking to.</p>

<p>If you have charitable impulses, it's much easier to be charitable with a healthy business behind you.</p>
<p>We have this image of striving for a business that's all put together. Focus instead on adding a little bit to a puzzle (not a perfect analogy, since there's no end state in business like there is in puzzles).</p>
<p>Every day, if you've added a piece to your business that wasn't there yesterday and will still be there in years, that's a great metric for success</p>
<h2 id="talktopeople">Talk to people</h2>
<p>It's never a bad time to talk to a customer or prospect. If you're capable of sending out cold emails, go for it.</p>
<h2 id="platformbeforeproduct">Platform before product</h2>
<p>Build a marketing platform to cater to an audience first.</p>
<p>Build at least:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 friendcatchers: don't learn to cook because you want to eat food, learn to cook because it's a great excuse to have people over. Build something that solves problems for people and you'll never lack people to talk to who have problems.</li>
<li>5 emails: (we'll talk about this later)</li>
<li>~45 days of grinding: you don't need a grand strategy or a fancy process, just talk/email/tweet to people every day</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="theidealfriendcatcher">The ideal friendcatcher</h3>
<p>TODO: ven diagram</p>
<p>The ideal friendcatcher solves a problem that is resonant, tractable, and underserved.</p>
<p>How? Pay attention to pain people have. Javascript developers feel visceral pain at the phrase "build pipeline" - write about that!</p>
<p>Great forms of friendcatchers:</p>
<ul>
<li>stick-a-fork-in-it-and-it-is-done guide to one broadly applicable, tightly scoped problem: People come to it for years.</li>
<li>calculator which replaces an excel spreadsheet: This is unreasonably effective because most people in the world can't program even at the level of silly excel spreadsheet. There's no level too trivial! A/B testing statistical significance is hard for normal people.</li>
<li>definitive curated list of resources: listicles! plant a flag on the internet of a definitive list of everything great and outstanding in this field. Josh Kaufman has <a href="https://personalmba.com/best-business-books/">the definitive list of business books</a>.</li>
<li>cheatsheet: Amy Hoy made the Ruby on Rails Cheatsheet that turned her into a celebrity in the Rails community</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>TODO: Stripe CTA screenshot</p>
<h2 id="emailliterallyeveryone">Email Literally Everyone</h2>
<p>Companies can't do lots of things at scale that you can. When you have ~100 people on your email list that want to hear from you, you have a huge advantage: you can email every single new subscriber individually. Be unreasonably interested in the topic and them. Do it every day until you get sick of it.</p>
<h3 id="everythingaboutemailcoursesinoneslide">Everything about email courses in one slide</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make a promise with every subject line and keep it. That's the one copywriting trick you need to know if you know no others.</li>
<li>75% education; 25% sales. You need both. <strong>Ask for the freaking sale at some point</strong></li>
<li>Frontload delivery. 3x in the first week is fine, then back off a little bit.</li>
<li>After the end of the course, email 1x every 2-4 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a world of people - find the people that love hearing from you, and establish the expectation that you'll be sending them more things they like.</p>
<h3 id="checkpoints">Checkpoints</h3>
<ul>
<li>10 great conversations (25 for SaaS)</li>
<li>500 emails</li>
<li>10 commits to buy (in SaaS) or you'll have a super hard time selling it.</li>
</ul>
<p>You're going to be talking to customers for the rest of your life. You're not in the "doing cool stuff with your business phase" until you've had 10 great conversations (25 for SaaS).</p>
<p>Why? It's easy to go in the code cave for a few weeks or months.</p>
<p>Don't start the fun expressive work until you've talked to people.</p>
<p>Don't worry about any kind of marketing automation until you have at least 500 people on your list.</p>
<h2 id="objectiveexternalindiciaofprogress">Objective external indicia of progress</h2>
<p>Patrick organizes his week like a dinner plate: one main course (50% of work), two side dishes, and everything else is a dessert that probably won't get done. One side dish should always be talking to customers.</p>
<p>For every piece of work you do (except talking to customers), you should have some indica of progress that's published.</p>
<h2 id="buildtheactualthing">Build the actual thing</h2>
<p>Building an awesome thing doesn't mean building the <em>best</em> thing. It doesn't have to be a work of outstanding genius that will be studied 200 years from now.</p>
<p>The bar for businesses in the economy is <em>just</em> above getting sued. It's disconcerting.</p>
<h3 id="abuseyouradvantages">Abuse your advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>"This is what I do" is an amazing sales message. Even if you just spend 60 days on something, you'll probably quickly become the world's leading expert in that thing. How many people are studying javascript pipelines? Saying "This is what I do" builds a lot of trust with customers. You can be the person that's <em>unreasonably</em> good at the details (like Patrick's loan officer talking to every underwriter for 2 hours)</li>
<li>Be <em>irrationally</em> responsive to customers, especially early</li>
<li>Most fast and <em>make things</em>. Most businesses don't have a development team capable of making <em>anything</em>, or a marketing team capable of <em>selling anything</em>. Check the microconf archives for more on this.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chargemore">Charge more</h2>
<p>Charging more will get you more money, get you better customers, and attract people who you want to attract.</p>
<p>How much more? Whatever your number is right now, raise it.</p>
<p>TODO: reasonable floors, but not ceilings slide</p>
<p>Charge at tiers to segment out customers getting outstanding value from you.</p>
<h2 id="stripeatlas">Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas helps companies get up and running. They can help create a C-Corp, S-Corp, business bank account, and community of business people to help you through problems.</p>
<p>Stripe giving you a business is like giving you a puppy - a year from now your business will be wagging its tale needing compliance and walks.</p>
<h2 id="businessadvice">Business advice</h2>
<h3 id="immediately">Immediately</h3>

<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Blog posts?</strong></p>
<p>Ahh yes! My blog has ~3M words on it. It was a mistake.</p>
<p>Don't make one of your life commitments keeping it up to date. A dead blog is worse than no blog at all.</p>
<p>Instead of a blog, post articles on your website that are definite evergreen guides.</p>
<p><strong>How did you become such a good storyteller?</strong></p>
<p>I'm the storyteller of my Irish Catholic family's generation. It seems to work for me for business, so I lean into it.</p>
<p>I don't have a great guide other than grinding at it. Tell more stories!</p>
<p>Try adopting narrative structure like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey">the hero's journey</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Do you hate B2C?</strong></p>
<p>I don't have an emotional hatred of B2C - I don't hate anyone anywhere. Hating people is a commitment of emotional energy in the future, and I'd rather commit to positive things.</p>
<p>Google has a war chest of a hundred billion dollars. You can't beat them at the B2C game.</p>
<p>If you have to, pick a demographic that has some money to pay and is super emotionally invested. Most consumers are pathologically bad at spending money on things. Prosumers like skaters who spend $800 on skates or <a href="#">the guy who sold gaming tables</a> are better.</p>
<p><strong>How do you split time spent talking to customers vs. building?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on where you are in the cycle. I do 50/25/25 to tactical marketing/talking to customers/product.</p>
<p>If I didn't have a laser focus of what the product is, I'd spend the 50 on talking to people. Do it first thing in the morning so you can do the trivial, easy, fun stuff of building stuff.</p>
<p><strong>My favorite talk is your <a href="https://vimeo.com/96701548">Hello Ladies talk from Business of software</a>. How do you build things for people who aren't you?</strong></p>
<p>Even software for software developers is a huge market opportunity - if you're building software for people similar to you, it's probably still a good market.</p>
<p>Some markets can't pay, so don't serve a market like that. A market like "women in tech positions" is a great underserved market.</p><h1>Your First 60 Days</h1><!-- ![Rob Walling at Microconf Growth 2018](https://i.imgur.com/aSdxyq5.jpg) -->

<p>Rob is a serial entrepreneur that most recently started <a href="https://www.drip.com/">Drip</a>, which was <a href="https://www.leadpages.net/blog/drip-acquisition/">acquired by Leadpages in 2016</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I am not anti-venture capital. I am anti-everyone-thinking-venture-capital-is-the-only-way-to-start-a-tech-company.</p>
  <p>If you’re self-funded with one or two founders, you can support your entire business from a tiny niche that provides $20k/month in revenue.</p>
  <p>But with venture capital (or even… angel funding) you are forced to go after much larger markets. And a market that's 10x the size is 100x harder to get right. There’s more competition, more complexity, higher ad rates, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having done both bootstrapping and a funded business, Rob knows the good and bad parts of VC funding.</p>
<h1 id="thebad">The Bad</h1>
<h2 id="1communicationispainful">1. Communication is painful</h2>
<p>Launching multiple features a week is much harder when you're not bootstrapped</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>At times I feel like I spend more time talking about building product than actually building product.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="2boardmeetingsareapainintheass">2. Board meetings are a pain in the ass</h2>
<h2 id="3cultureishard">3. Culture is Hard</h2>
<p>When you hit 15 or 20 employees, culture gets really hard.</p>
<p>It's easy to do it badly (like with a <a href="http://www.joe-ks.com/archives_feb2001/ManualMSG.htm">mission statement generator</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">Netflix Culture Document</a> and <a href="https://blog.balsamiq.com/mantras/">Balsamiq Culture Document</a> do it well.</p>
<h2 id="4hireforbothskillandpersonality">4. Hire for both skill and personality</h2>
<p>If you hire just for skill, you get folks in who aren't a good fit.</p>
<p>If you hire just for personality, you have to train everyone and can't move very fast.</p>
<h2 id="5thingsrobneverhadtodealwith">5. Things Rob never had to deal with</h2>
<p>Classic things like raising funding, monthly reporting, annual audits, and legal complexities Rob didn't need to deal with.</p>
<h1 id="thegood">The Good</h1>
<h2 id="1youcanhirespecialists">1. You can hire specialists</h2>
<p>Specialists and partnerships give you a huge boost in growth and make it easier to run your company. Areas like HR, specialized developers, and GDPR are ripe for specialists.</p>
<h2 id="2paymarketsalaries">2. Pay Market Salaries</h2>
<p>Early on, Rob lost a great developer because of a $10k difference in salary. Having more money means you don't need to make this compromise.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YA61Htz.png" alt="Being venture baked lets you pay market salaries" /></p>
<h2 id="3hireseniortalent">3. Hire Senior Talent</h2>
<p>Only being able to afford junior developers means you move much slower.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Sf22YOe.png" alt="Only being able to afford junior developers means you move much slower." /></p>
<h2 id="4usearecruiter">4. Use a recruiter</h2>
<p>As a bootstrapped founder, you don't realize how much of your time you spend on hiring.</p>
<p><em>If</em> Rob starts another company, he'd hire a recruiter a lot earlier.</p>
<h2 id="5dontwastetimetosaveafewdollars">5. Don't waste time to save a few dollars</h2>
<p>As a bootstrapped founder, you feel compelled to penny pinch and save little dollar amounts in places like AWS, which is taking away focus from the rest of what you're trying to do.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FqqbHtY.jpg" alt="Don't waste time to save a few dollars - just increase your revenue" /></p>
<p>What's wasted time? If you're evaluating Kayako or intercom and thinking mostly about price, you're probably wasting your time. Same for Zoho vs. Gmail, Wistia vs. Sprout Vieo, GoDaddy Hosting vs. WPEngine, etc.</p>
<h2 id="6usestandardjobtitles">6. Use Standard Job Titles</h2>
<p>In a bootstrapped company, you just make up job titles. Once you have a recruiter who's searching for new people to fill your made up positions (ex: "Senior Scaling Architect"), your life will be much easier if you use more standard titles.</p>
<p>Also, don't elevate titles too early. If you hire a normal customer success person, don't name them "Head of Customer Success".</p>
<h2 id="7belessstressed">7. Be less stressed?</h2>
<p>You can be a hell of a lot less stressed when you can just hire people to handle the tedious problems of business. It's not guaranteed to make you less stressed, though.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NP5MLAv.jpg" alt="Does venture funding make you more or less stressed? @jordangal" /></p>

<h1 id="sowhatcanyoudo">So… what can you do?</h1>
<p>Rob isn't saying you <em>should</em> raise funding, but there are definitely things to learn from it.</p>
<p>Here are some options:</p>
<ul>
<li>continue bootstrapping</li>
<li>consider VC-Funding (gross)</li>
<li>"Fundstrapping": raise some money at the beginning, then never raise money again</li>
</ul>
<p>When fundstrapping, boostrap to $20-30k MRR, then raise a single Angel round. You'll get the best of both worlds.</p>
<h1 id="tldr">tl;dr:</h1>
<p>Funding lets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hire for specialization</li>
<li>Pay market salaries</li>
<li>Hire senior talent</li>
<li>Hire faster</li>
<li>Work with a recruiter</li>
<li>Not waste time to save a few $$</li>
<li>Use standard job titles</li>
<li>Be less stressed</li>
</ul>
<p>"Fundstrap" with a single round of funding to get the benefits.</p>

<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Did you have to answer to a board?</strong></p>
<p>We had enough luxury to hand pick who was on our board, and we got along really will with them. It could've been a shit show.</p>
<p><strong>It sounds like a lot of your negative parts of funding are just things that happen at scale.</strong></p>
<p>It's exacerbated when you have funding. Basecamp has grown over 12 years; hiring ~4 people a year makes it much easier to establish culture. Moving faster with funding makes it a lot harder to establish culture.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have advice on protecting culture?</strong></p>
<p>Yes - write things down, and hire people who are on board with your written vision.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you wish you could've afforded?</strong></p>
<p>Customer acquisition! Leadpages perfected the paid acquisition revenue model.</p>
<p><strong>As a micropreneur, what's the advantage of fundstrapping over a bank loan?</strong></p>
<p>If you want to be a solopreneur, grow something up to $10k or $20k MRR and have an awesome lifestyle business. Rob did that for several years and eventually wanted something more.</p>
<p>The advantage over a bank loan is that it's lower risk - if the business fails, your personal credit isn't destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>If I fundstrap, how much of my business do I need to give up?</strong></p>
<p>First bootstrap to the $20-30k MRR mark so you have a $4-6M valuation, then sell 10% for ~$500k.</p>
<p><strong>When do you pay it back?</strong></p>
<p>Either when you get acquired or by paying dividends.</p><h1>12 Lessons I learned Moving from Bootstrapped to Venture Backed</h1><p>Parallel entrepreneurship has a negative stigma, but there are a lot of people in this room that do it successfully.</p>
<p>There are also several public examples of superhuman parallel entrepreneurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jack Dorsey (Twitter and Square)</li>
<li>Marcia Kilgore (Bliss, Soap &amp; Glory, FitFlop, Soaper Duper, Beauty Pie)</li>
<li>Elon Musk (freakin' everything)</li>
</ul>

  <p>Why should investors get to invest in parallel startups and entrepreneurs only get to work on one?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="reasonstobeaparallelentrepreneurfromsurveys">Reasons to be a parallel entrepreneur (from surveys)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pursuing a passion</li>
<li>diversifying and de-risking</li>
<li>developing a new skill</li>
<li>being more productive</li>
<li>exploring a new career</li>
</ul>
<p>Most parallel entrepreneurs have backgrounds in writing or finance, not programming. They're able to switch between different projects by being very regimented and being creative about their resources.</p>
<p>Fun fact: most parallel entrepreneurs structure their businesses as LLCs.</p>

<h2 id="lesson1takeincrementalandmeasurablerisks">Lesson 1: Take Incremental and Measurable Risks</h2>
<p>When you do come to sell, you need to be in a position to prove any of your claims. If you claim your users doubled over a period, you need to show how you measured that.</p>
<p>If you want to test pricing, incrementally measure the success of testing pricing on a smaller group.</p>
<p>Companies that have been successfully sold take small, incremental risks. If you're not failing often, you're not trying hard enough. You should be continually testing experiments to see what works.</p>

<h2 id="lesson2makeitsustainable">Lesson 2: Make it sustainable</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rBoZtnI.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Key mistakes when people are just starting out is to give away far too much value for not a lot of return. Don't sell lifetime subscriptions to your product to a cheap price. Don't give away annual plans at a massive discount.</p>
<h2 id="lesson3focusonmrrgrowthandrevenuechurn">Lesson 3: Focus on MRR growth and revenue churn</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EyVRhTY.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you're ever going to sell, MRR growth is a big factor. Focus on sustainably growing MRR and decreasing revenue churn (customer churn doesn't matter as much).</p>
<p>People paying you the most money are probably sending you the least number of complaints. Put things in place to keep those valuable customers happy and you can churn the lower value customers without affecting revenue churn.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A decision that raises revenue even though it churns vocal users is a good decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Word of mouth has a CAC of zero, but it's hard to scale a business whose growth strategy is word of mouth.</p>
<p>Ignore customer churn and focus on revenue churn. Focus more on the cohorts that are paying you the most.</p>
<p>Don't fall victim to feature creep: focus on revenue.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Almost every SaaS business out there doesn't do pricing very well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Build in expansion revenue. Don't have an unlimited plan, let users pay you more the more they use your platform.</p>
