He's always wanted to launch a side project (so he could get rich and be on the cover of tech crunch).\n\nAdam's first attempt at a product came from an idea he had for automating code reviews in PHP. He spent months and months coding it alone, then one day tweeted out an announcement for [Nitpick](https://nitpick-ci.com/) and expected the fame and money to come rolling in.\n\n![Refactoring to Collections launch sales #small](https://i.imgur.com/rBf7Rhd.png)\n\nThat launch was in November of 2015. Since launching, it's only made $3,650 in sales from 19 customers.\n\nWorking a full time job, Adam didn't have the resources to grow Nitpick and started looking for another way to make a living with an online product.\n\nThe next thing he tried was an infoproduct - Refactoring to Collections (launched in May 2016). Adam spent time researching successful product launches this time so he could get the process right.\n\nIn the first three days Refactoring to Collections made $61k - about 17x what Nitpick has ever made.\n\n<!-- ![Adam's sales in just his first two years of info-product business #small](https://i.imgur.com/0vNvKhC.png) -->\n\n![Test Driven Laravel launch sales #small](https://i.imgur.com/TFvQ0Mk.png)\n\nTwo weeks later, Adam felt confident enough in his ability to launch that he quit his job to work on products full time.\n\nHis next (and much more ambitious) product was [Test Driven Laravel](https://course.testdrivenlaravel.com/). Adam launched Test Driven Laravel six months after launching Refactoring to Collections to $116k of revenue in the first three days.\n\nIn two years (May 2016 to April 2018), Adam has made about $650k from launching info products, so he knows what he's talking about.\n\n# Info Products\n\n![Rob Walling hadoukens his Stair Step approach - a great model for starting with an info-product instead of a SaaS #medium](https://i.imgur.com/IvrS4Iq.jpg)\n\n## Why an Info-Product?\n\n- One-time purchase products are way easier to sell. Don't we all have an ebook saved on our laptop that we bought and never actually read? The person who made that ebook has your aspirational $20, but the $4 re-occurring charge for a service that you canceled when you didn't use it one month isn't getting your money anymore.\n- They can be \"done.\" A SaaS has to be maintained forever, but an ebook or course has a finish line.\n- You can put one together in 3 months of nights and weekends.\n- They put money in the bank fast, then drop off, which is the opposite of the SaaS ramp of death. That fast money up front can be used to bankroll your time so you can invest in other things (like a Saas?).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/brennandunn/status/982326554414985216\n\n# Getting Started on Your Info-Product\n\n## Why build an audience?\n\n- Having a large audience can make up for any other deficiency in your marketing plan. A huge audience and a terrible strategy beats a perfect marketing strategy and no audience.\n- You can't just throw up a landing page and expect people to sign up; people need to trust you and believe that you're the right person to help them. An audience is effectively a collection of people who already trust you and know that you're good at helping them, so they're much easier to sell to.\n\n## How do you build an audience?\n\n> A large audience can make up for any other deficiency in your marketing plan. Build one by being helpful on the internet.\n\nBe helpful on the Internet! This means blog posts, tutorials, screencasts, podcasts, interviews, anything that makes you worth following.\n\nA specific strategy that works well for Adam, which he stole from his friend @wesbos, is to help people where they already are.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/wesbos/status/984500364245389312\n\nWhere are people? The type of person Wes Bos is interested in helping - web developers - are on Twitter! Wes Bos doesn't tweet links to blog posts somewhere else; he helps web developers as they're scrolling through twitter. This strategy earns Wes fantastic engagement and an enormous audience.\n\nAdam frequently tweets [these same bite-sized useful nuggets](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/829423543985307661) to his audience of Laravel developers (who are also already on Twitter).\n\n### Case Study: Steve Schoger\n\nBuilding an audience can be daunting if you're starting from zero, but it's simple if you follow the strategy.\n\nIn Setember 2016 [@steveschoger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger) had 436 twitter followers. He was tweeting typical social media updates (\".@Fedex has the worst customer service ever...\"), which no one cares about.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/981606881255976961\n\nBut he wanted to grow his audience, so Steve started posting helpful tweets about his area of expertise: design. These helpful tweets got way more engagement right away ([18 retweets and 246 likes on a tweet](https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/870679289624092673) when Steve only had 800 followers).\n\nIn less that a year and a half, using the strategy of helping people where they are, Steve has jumped to over 20k followers, and his tweets typically get thousands of likes.\n\n# Picking the Right Idea\n\n## Step 1: Have an Idea\n\n- What are you already putting out there that people seem excited about?\n- What are you excited about that you think others will get excited about? What do you think you are ahead of the curve on?\n- What do people think you're better than them at? What sorts of questions are people asking you? If people think you're better than them at something, that's an opportunity to teach.\n\n> You could be the Christopher Columbus of programming knowledge.\n\n- What have you learned outside your community/watering hole that you think your community would benefit from? That's right, you don't have to invent these ideas yourself, you can just re-package things that already exist!\n- What did you have to figure out yourself that was really helpful to learn? Other people are probably struggling with the same thing, and you could make it easier for them!\n\n## Step 2: Test It\n\nSome people would tell you to throw up a landing page first thing and try to get people's emails to see if people are interested in your idea. But Adam thinks you should do these things first:\n\n- Tests ideas with [small tweets](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/956620857236959232) (or message board posts, or whatever else you use to communicate with your people):\n- If it looks like things are working in a small format, move on to a longer form, like a high quality, long-form, comprehensive blog post.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/976909385938059264\n\n- Catalog any good feedback you get about this test content, like replies on Twitter (\"this is the guide I wish I had when I was learning!\"), blog post comments, etc. This feedback will be useful when building your landing page.\n\n## Step 3: Define the Product\n\n- Start by planning small, because the product will end up bigger than you think. Planning small will also help you be concise: a short book is still a book, and a 3 hour video course can totally be sufficient.\n- Books are a lot easier to work on than products that require recording, like courses, especially if you only have short blocks of time.\n- Courses are easier to sell at a higher price than books (which people are conditioned to think should cost $20-$40, even if it's a specialized book that provides a lot more value), but a lot harder to produce on nights and weekends.\n\n# Putting up a Landing Page\n\nThe landing page collects your email addresses, and confirms that people are interested in this topic as a product, not just a tweet.\n\n- Start with a clear headline that explains what users will learn from your product. For Adam's [Advanced Vue Component Design's landing page,](https://adamwathan.me/advanced-vue-component-design/) that headline is: \"Learn how to design simpler, more flexible components that are both more powerful and easier to maintain.\"\n\n![Advanced Vue Component Design's Landing Page](https://i.imgur.com/YVfPkj5.jpg)\n\n- Next, give people a clear incentive to sign up for your email list - not just \"sign up if you're interested!\" Give them a reason to give you their email address! Promise them some free content. In the example above the incentive is clear: \"Sign up for **free screencasts** and a **big discount** when the course is released this May.\"\n\n- Be sure to give people some evidence that proves you know what you're talking about. On Adam's landing page the link to [Renderless Components in Vue.js](https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/) proves Adam is an expert. He's the real deal - you can trust him.\n\n- Throw in pieces of social proof that you know your stuff, like the testimonials you collected when testing your content. This doesn't have to be a review from an influencer, it just has to serve the same purpose as an Amazon review.\n\n![The link to Adam's previous work, Renderless Components in Vue.js, and the review from a fan help convince landing-page-viewers that they can trust Adam as an authority, which makes it more likely they'll give him their email. #large](https://i.imgur.com/LnvKNih.png)\n\n- Then, outline what you're planning to do with your product. Keep it simple.\n\n- At the end of the page drop another sign up form, with a little bit more social proof. This is for those people who needed to read your whole page to be convinced to give you their email.\n\n- Finally, finish up your page with a little \"Who Am I?\" section. Link to Twitter, any other products you've already released, or even just cool things you've made or done, like your blog, conference talks, etc. This is another way to convince someone that you can be trusted to know what you're talking about.\n\n# Side Note: Should You Pre-Sell?\n\nAdam has done it both ways: he completely finished and then released his first product, and released his second product in early access when he was done with 20%, then added new content as he went on. Both ways have tradeoffs.\n\n## Pre-selling Advantages\n\n- Pre-sales are the best form of product validation. If someone gives you money before you've created it, that's great proof that they're actually interested.\n- You'll make more money because you'll have more opportunity to promote the product by telling people about product updates, without seeming spammy with \"buy this! buy this! buy this!\" emails. You can send out non-spammy update messages as you publish more content.\n- You might have more motivation to finish. If you already have people's money, you'll push through burnout. You don't want to not deliver on something people have already paid you for.\n- Pre-sales can buy you the time to focus on the product. If you have a successful pre-launch, you can afford to do less freelance work to buy more of your time for this product.\n\n## Pre-selling Disadvantages\n\n> \"Holy fuck I gotta finish this thing or people are gonna be so fucking angry.\"\n\n- Selling multiple tiers is trickier. It's harder to get people to buy the more expensive packages if right now all users get the same thing from your product (because the fancy add-ons aren't ready yet).\n- You can't easily change scope. Cutting scope is a great way to make your goal more attainable, but if you pre-sell and promise too much, then you can end up in a situation where it takes you way longer to finish, which is a beat-down.\n- Prelaunching is like taking on debt. Mechanically, pre-sales make you more money. Psychologically, they can be really stressful.\n\n# Building Your Email List\n\n## Step #1: Tell Your Audience\n\nhttps://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/978661856687484928\n\nTelling your audience you have a landing page they can sign up for is an obvious step. You can get an extra boost by first announcing that you're going to announce your landing page before you announce it.\n\nThese pre-pre-launch announcements won't get much engagement, but they prime your audience to share your real announcement.\n\nThen, announce to your existing audience.\n\n![https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/988443466890854402](https://i.imgur.com/H863Pkw.png)\n\n## Step #2: Share Progress\n\nYou usually get your biggest spike in sign-ups at launch. It's easy for sign-ups to drop off completely after the announcement, but you can help sustain sign-ups by keeping your list engaged and excited about the product by sharing updates, especially updates with a bit of free content.\n\nIf you don't have anything free to send out, just send out a [behind-the-scenes work update](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/987362810521792512).\n\nDon't just share these updates with people who have already signed up. Put pre-launch updates on public watering holes your audience hangs out at too (like Twitter), to encourage new people to sign up.\n\n## Step #3: Re-purpose Content\n\n![Re-purpose the content you already have. This blog post is a lesson from Adam Wathan's paid video course that he's massaged into a more sharable format.](https://i.imgur.com/5YaplDi.png)\n\nIf you're working on this project part-time, then it can be hard to also be generating content to market your product. It's much easier to re-purposing your main content into a stand-alone blog post.\n\nBe sure to mention that your re-purposed content is from a product that you're currently making, and throw in a call to action for sign-ups.\n\n# Getting It Finished\n\n## Strategy #1: Make Public Promises\n\nPromising things to people on public platforms can make you feel accountable and motivated to deliver.\n\n## Strategy #2: Email on a Schedule\n\n> I'm afraid to go a week without emailing people.\n\nFor Adam's audience, emailing once a week makes sure people stay excited and don't forget about what he's working on.\n\n## Strategy #3: Reduce Scope\n\nIf you find you've been working on your product for 6 months, but there's no end in sight, and you already have something substantial, then just move the finish line closer by reducing the scope of your project.\n\n# Figuring Out Pricing\n\n## Topic #1: Tiered Pricing\n\n### Single Tier/No Tier Pricing\n\n- Can be fine if you can charge enough for your one tier.\n- Often necessary if you're pre-selling.\n- Nice if you can't figure out a way to add additional tiers that actually feel valuable.\n\nIn general though, prefer multiple tiers.\n\n![Wes Bos's second tier is only $10 more, but it has twice as much content, displaying the price anchoring strategy.](https://i.imgur.com/8jjKhqg.jpg)\n\n### Two Tier Pricing\n\nUse price anchoring: make the second tier your real product, with the first tier as a reduced version of your product that really only exists to push people to the second tier.\n\n- The first tier is just there to make the second tier look like a better deal, since the prices are close and the content is directly comparable.\n- This works well with video courses, where it's easy to cut content for the budget version.\n\n![Even though the top tier of Adam's book Refactoring to Collections only sold 220 copies, it made the most money thanks to bonus content that wasn't even as valuable as the book.](https://i.imgur.com/XdTnSaI.png)\n\n### Three Tier Pricing\n\n- Great for books if you can come up with the bonus content.\n- Makes it easier for users to evaluate your product on its own instead of comparing it to Amazon book or something else.\n- Prices are usually 1x, ~2x, and ~5x (ex: $29, $59, and $135 for Refactoring to Collections).\n- This will make you a lot more money from a book than just selling the book on its own. Adam's first $29 tier made $7,400, his second $59 tier made $24,800, and his third $135 tier made $29,000. Without the second and third tier, Adam would've left 58% of the money on the table.\n- Adding content to tiers helps people evaluate the product as its own offering instead of just a cheap pdf, even though the bonus content you throw in isn't necessarily as valuable as the book.\n\n## Topic #2: Launch Discounts\n\n- Discount it by enough to be appealing, at least 30%.\n- Use stepped discounts. Lower discount on cheaper tiers and better discount on higher tiers will push people up to the better tiers.\n- Reverse engineer the non-discounted price from your planned discounted price. That means don't discount the price you want to charge! Pick the price that you want to charge (ex: $79), make that the \"discounted\" price, and make the \"un-discounted\" price your preferred price plus whatever you're taking off with the discount (ex: the original price of a $79 book that's been discounted by 30% is `79/(1-0.3) ≈ 113`, so set the original price at $119).\n\n# Nailing the Launch\n\nThis is actually the easy part of the whole thing!\n\n## Step #1: Build the Sales Page\n\n![The Refactoring to Collections product tiers. The most expensive one is first and looks like it includes a lot more stuff.](https://i.imgur.com/9XxDoBD.png)\n\n- Even once you've launched, include an email sign up! A lot of people are tire-kickers who are just on your page to see free content. Once you have their email though, you can try to sell them stuff.\n- Use testimonials and social proof. You can use feedback from preview content to start off.\n- Sort tiers from highest price to lowest price, and make sure your visuals communicate that your highest tier is the biggest, most real product that people should want.\n\n### Step #2: Announce the Launch Details\n\n- Send out an email saying: I got it done. Include all package and pricing details, as well as the launch date.\n- If you can, send out some final free content.\n\nAdam published [a detailed blog post of his Refactoring to Collections launch](https://adamwathan.me/the-book-launch-that-let-me-quit-my-job/) which includes the emails he sent at every stage of development.\n\n![One of Adam Wathan's early launch emails for Refactoring to Collections from his blog post: https://adamwathan.me/the-book-launch-that-let-me-quit-my-job/ #large](https://i.imgur.com/sXdkjLN.png)\n\n### Step #3: Launch It\n\nThe easiest and most fun part!\n\n- Send out a simple email: \"It's available, all the info is here at the website.\"\n- Leverage your time zones if you need to. Adam uses morning Eastern Time Zone to launch things because he has a lot of European customers.\n- Pick you favorite day to send it\n\n> I like Tuesdays. I have no evidence, but it seems like a good day to launch things. Monday is too early, every other day seems too late. Tuesday seems fine.\n\n- Sit back and make money!\n\n### Step #4: Leverage Early Feedback\n\nYou're not done! You still have more emails to send.\n\nCatalog feedback from the first people who buy your product, including tweets.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/philwinkle/status/733273064201392128\n\nA couple days later send an email to everyone that hasn't bought your product yet with this early feedback, and a bunch more people will buy it!\n\nSend another free preview if you can. Don't be afraid of giving out free content! Adam has given out about 60% of his content for free.\n\n### Step #5: Closing the Launch\n\nDon't specify a closing date in advance.\n\nHaving a specified launch closing date can make you feel obligated to shut down a launch discount that is making you tons of money. Adam has done that. It sucked.\n\n> I had a money hose that was just like firing money at me, and I was just like \"Oh, we gotta get this under control! We gotta turn this off! I don't want this money!\"\n\nTell people that during the launch there will be a discount, and don't specify how long the launch will be. If anyone asks, just say it's closing \"within the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nLook at a graph of your sales to see when sales are slowing down and plan a closing date about a week after that.\n\nYour email announcing the launch sale ending will generate another bump in sales.\n\n# Adam Wathan's Recommended Microconf Resources\n\nSource: [Adam's Github Info Link](https://gist.github.com/adamwathan/30dc4230ac575cfa3425b39ca11ea859)\n\n## Tools for selling your product online\n\n- [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/): _what I use, biggest pro is you just get a single deposit each week direct to bank account, no dealing with Stripe/PayPal directly, so much easier for accounting/book-keeping, especially if you live somewhere where you need to worry about collecting sales tax_\n- [Podia](https://www.podia.com/): _bring your own Stripe/PayPal but has a great course editor which Gumroad doesn't have_\n\n## Email marketing tools\n\n- [ConvertKit](http://mbsy.co/convertkit/20592464): _what I use, no complaints_\n- [Drip](https://www.drip.com/): _also great, would have no reason to switch away if I was using it_\n\n## Sales page examples\n\n- [Refactoring to Collections](https://adamwathan.me/refactoring-to-collections/): _my first product_\n- [Test-Driven Laravel](https://course.testdrivenlaravel.com/): _my second product_\n\n## Coming soon page examples\n\n- [Advanced Vue Component Design](https://adamwathan.me/advanced-vue-component-design/): _my next course_\n\n## Reading material\n\n- [Recap of my Refactoring to Collections launch](https://adamwathan.me/the-book-launch-that-let-me-quit-my-job/): _includes tons of details, full content for every email sent, etc._\n- [\"Authority\"](http://nathanbarry.com/authority/): _book by Nathan Barry (best price here: https://gumroad.com/l/authority)_\n- [\"An eBook pricing model that resulted in $100,000 in sales\"](https://blog.asmartbear.com/selling-ebook.html): _blog post on tiered pricing_\n\n# Question\n\n**From your charts it looked like you had huge revenue spikes at launch, but also a long tail of revenue on both products. Did you re-prime the pump?**\n\n_Those charts are just for the first three days, so that wasn't a huge tail._\n\n_When I've released in early access before, it's been easy to update people about new content, which gets new people to see and buy the product, especially since it was still at an early access price._\n\n_For my book, sales dropped off very seriously after the launch was over, which is why I feel like I made a big mistake in closing the launch after three days._\n\n_I got around this mistake a little by sending out an email telling people that they could still get the launch discount because I had gotten back feedback that people had just been unable to get to the launch discount in time._\n\n_In general now, I send people free content over 2 weeks after the launch, and if they haven't bought the product by then I send them a coupon for a big discount that expires really soon, which encourages people to buy immediately.

Between in-app messages, scheduling demos, and setting up scheduled emails when people leave your product, there is a lot of complexity:\n\n- How do you get people to do things?\n- How do you know what you should be getting people to do?\n- How do you set up behaviorally triggered sequences so it doesn't explode into sending someone 15 emails a single day?\n- How do you figure out what to put in the emails?\n\nThis talk is about simplifying that complexity so you know exactly what you need to do.\n\n# Hidden Work\n\n> People don't want software, they want their problems solved.\n\nWe can think about onboarding from much simpler core questions. First, why do people stop trying to solve their problems with your software? People don't want software, they want their problems solved.\n\nAlli believes the reason people quit using your software is that there's a mismatch between the easy journey your customer expects to take, and the arduous journey you force on them.\n\n![Climbing a mountain is hard, but you can be motivated to climb all the way through if you feel like you're making progress by getting tiny wins along the way. #large](https://i.imgur.com/VO2HF3X.png)\n\nTo help your customers solve their problems (and therefore decrease the chance that they'll quit your software) focus on removing **hidden work** - the inessential work that your customers aren't expecting to need to do to solve their problem.\n\nThere are two types of hidden work to focus on removing: product-centric hidden work, and internal hidden work.\n\n## 1. Product-Centric Hidden Work\n\nProduct-Centric Work is the work of figuring out how to use a new product.\n\nHere are 3 common examples of emails that include product-centric hidden work.\n\n![An example of forcing your users to watch your vacation photos (watch 22 minute webinars) before you let them eat deviled eggs (upload their photos). #large](https://i.imgur.com/dXzABJ9.png)\n\n### 1. The \"Vacation Photos\" Approach\n\nWhen you're invited over to someone's house for a dinner party, it sucks if you have to look at their vacation photos before you can eat the deviled eggs.\n\nIn the same way: if your user has a simple problem, don't make them read your product manual or watch a 22 minute webinar before they can get started. Give them precisely what they need to solve the exact problem they have and cut away everything else.\n\n---\n\n![This company is giving their users 7 things to do (each blue line is a call to action) in their first email, which is too many. Most users will likely choose to do nothing. #large](https://i.imgur.com/6EZTmIk.png)\n\n### 2. The \"Too Much Too Soon\" Approach\n\nIf you ask your users to do too much too soon, you give them [decision fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue), which doesn't increase the chance they'll take any action. This is known of as the \"rule of one\" in email marketing: reducing the actions you're asking of your users to a single actionable step dramatically increases the percent of people who take any action.\n\n---\n\n![The Bad Intern approach to onboarding - bleh #large](https://i.imgur.com/Qlq6fz3.png)\n\n### 3. The \"Clueless Intern\" Approach\n\nDon't force your users to figure out what to do first. Your users shouldn't need to become an expert on your product before they can evaluate if they like it.\n\n> No one wants software, they just want their problems solved.\n\nPeople are signing up because they have a specific problem they want to solve. They don't want to read a quick start guide, they want their problem solved. If you make it hard for them to solve it, only the most committed people will get through your bad onboarding.\n\n---\n\n![The project management app Harvest has a great first onboarding email that prompts users to Create a Project.](https://i.imgur.com/5tfdgaK.png)\n\n### A Better Approach\n\nFocus on the core actions your users need to take to get value out of your product and solve their problems.\n\nThe project management app [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) can solve a lot of problems for its users: calculating how much a project costs, keeping projects on track, getting clients to pay faster, etc.\n\nUsers can't do any of that until they've performed the first tiny action of creating a project, though, so that's what the first onboarding email from Harvest prompts them to do.\n\nWhat's the one tiny action your users can take to start them on the journey of solving their problems?\n\nTry these tools to collect data that may help you figure out what that action could be: [Userlist](https://userlist.io/), [mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/), [kissmetrics](https://www.kissmetricshq.com/), [looker](https://looker.com/), and [heap analytics](https://heapanalytics.com/).\n\nFocus on comparing what users are doing right before they upgrade to what users are doing right before they quit.\n\n![A simpler model for email sequences looks like a grid. Each column is a specific action for a user to take, and each square is an individual email. Each user will only get a subset of the emails (shown here in green).](https://i.imgur.com/SG8tHN2.png)\n\nOnce you know the actions you want to be encouraging your users to take, it's much easier to write an onboarding email sequence. Simply write a series of emails for each onboarding action, and trigger that sequence with a behavior from your user.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Internal Hidden Work\n\nInternal hidden work is the work of getting yourself to do what you want to do. Customers need help with this work too, even more than they need help with the product-centric work of using your software.\n\n<!-- Your customers may want better SEO, but know that improving it would take a lot of effort, so they prioritize other tasks above it and let themselves become distracted. -->\n\nYour customers may want to use your software, but need to first convince their boss that this is a problem worth spending money on. You could help them by writing an email to their boss for them!\n\n![An example customer response to an email asking what's going on in their world.](https://i.imgur.com/bmyCSs6.jpg)\n\nHow do you figure out what your customer's internal work is? Research your customers by setting up basic onboarding automation:\n\n1.  Set up a landing page with an email signup form\n2.  When users sign up, send them a welcome email asking \"Hey, what's going on in your world? Why'd you sign up for this product?\" (this question will get you a gold mine of data)\n3.  Respond to new users to build relationships\n\nTo get to the \"why\" behind the responses you get back, look for outcome phrases: \"I signed up for your product **so I can...**\", \"I want to **be able to...**\", etc.\n\nHere are some free tools for cataloging this user research:\n\n- [Airstory](https://www.airstory.co/): free tool for clipping, organizing, and writing with the voice of your customer\n- [Nomnom](https://nomnominsights.com/): aggregate customer feedback on an existing project\n- [Usability-Hub](https://usabilityhub.com/): get feedback on usability for features you're working on\n\nAfter going through this research, you should be able to answer these questions about your customer:\n\n- What's the \"job\" that your customer hires you to do?\n- What's going on in their world that made someone consider your product?\n- What outcome are they looking for?\n- What do they believe about their problem?\n\n# How do you write an onboarding email?\n\nAn onboarding email should have three parts:\n\n1.  **Message-Matching**: Help someone overcome their internal hurdles (internal hidden work).\n2.  **Instructions**: The step-by-step guide to eliminate the product-centric work involved with doing what you're asking them to do to solve their problem.\n3.  **Call to Action**: Invite them to complete the action they need to take now.\n\n<!-- ![An example of an onboarding message that uses message-matching, instructions, and two calls to action.](https://i.imgur.com/02PzMyr.png) -->\n\n![Exact Phrase Message Matching in action on BananaBlaster](https://i.imgur.com/l87JoQf.png)\n\nThe purpose of every onboarding email is to get your customers to come back and use your product. Unless your product is a Hotel California, everyone is always leaving.\n\nHere's an example of what this could look like for a fictional product that helps keep track of your bananas:\n\n1.  **Message-Matching**: _The hardest thing about running a banana stand is keeping track of your bananas. But if your whole team is trained the same way, it will be easier._\n2.  **Instructions**: _You can send your employees pre-written training materials from your Banana Blaster dashboard. Here are the steps you need to take to do that..._\n3.  **Call to Action**: _Send pre-written training docs to your team._\n\n<!-- You should also pay attention to how your customer is going to be using this information. Are they going to be on the subway and can't load your links? -->\n\n<!-- ![Joining the conversation happening in your reader's head works.](https://i.imgur.com/ozMUGha.png) -->\n\n<!-- You can say \"there are 35 ways to use this project\" but it doesn't work as well as joining the conversation happening in your reader's head and solving the problem they're having _right now_. -->\n\n<!-- Making it easy to get started works. Harvest's \"Create a Project\" email hasn't changed in years. -->\n\n<!-- ![Talking to people like they are real people works.](https://i.imgur.com/4O0sH20.png) -->\n\n<!-- ![Getting rid of the hidden work involved with learning a new software works.](https://i.imgur.com/7oy0Wix.png) -->\n\n# Takeaway\n\nOnboarding can seem scary and technical, but it's fundamentally about helping people.\n\nTo help your customers get started, get the right mindset:\n\n- You're teaching people something new\n- You're solving their problems\n- You're eliminating hidden work\n\n_Thanks to:_\n\n- _Tanya Snook for letting me quote her_\n- _Val Geisler for letting me quote her case study_\n- _Sofia Quintero at Nom Nom for sharing data on her emails_\n- _Jane Portman for sharing results from her Tiny Reminder email_\n- _Coral Edwards for sharing backstory on Harvest_\n\n# Questions\n\n**When bootstrapping you have to make hard choices on what to prioritize. How do incrementally build the 20 user onboarding email sequence?**\n\n_You're always going to be strapped for time, but you should never start with zero emails and zero help. If it's a matter of waiting a few weeks to launch with email onboarding, I'd say wait._\n\n_Get started by sending emails at the top of the sequence: one email for each action. Send emails out based on the actions you're hypothesizing people will take, and look at data to test if that's actually the actions they take and if you need to write more emails in the sequence for that action._\n\n_Start by just asking \"what's going on in your world?\"_\n\n**In your examples of emails, they're all plaintext. We've noticed those do a lot better (because people are sick of the Mailchimp template). Our current onboarding series can't be plaintext because they have screenshots. Thoughts?**\n\n_Test what works best for you. I recommend plaintext as a starting point._\n\n**Can the \"what's up in your world\" research emails and the \"here's our product\" call to action emails be in the same email?**\n\n_Keep each email tightly focused on a single action._\n\n**How do you consider in-app onboarding?**\n\n_You want both in-app and email onboarding. Email onboarding is for when they leave your app._\n\n_A lot of onboarding in-app happens right when you sign up, but often people sign up at 2am when they're not ready to actually onboard._\n\nCheck out [Alli's free course on onboarding](https://alliblum.com), [download her slides](https://alliblum.com/microconf-2018), and email her at alli@alliblum.com.\n\n<!-- This is effectively the [Jobs to be Done](https://microconf.gen.co/claire-suellentrop) framework. -->\n\n<!-- > Your customer's biggest problem is unlikely to be that they want to try your features. -->\n\n<!-- Your customer may hate software, but still have the pain your software solves. -->\n\n<!-- https://twitter.com/spydergrrl/status/955218540977631232 -->\n\n<!-- Don't just _pretend_ to go through UX research (\"UX theatre\").

How to grow monthly recurring revenue (MRR) 30% every month for 30 months.\n2. Strategies for growing past $500k MRR.\n3. How to increase average revenue per customer (ARPU) by 25% with one simple pricing change.\n\n# Teachable's Revenue Snapshot\n\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) growth is supposed to be super exciting: peaks of irrational exuberance followed by a trough of disillusionment, a quick climb back up the slope of reality, and then a realization of your idea's actual value.\n\n![Expectation of SaaS company value #large](https://i.imgur.com/Gupffe5.png)\n\nIn practice, growing to $10M annual recurring revenue (ARR) for Teachable was slow and boring.\n\n![Teachable's slow boring revenue graph from 0 to $10M ARR #large](https://i.imgur.com/VBlsGTl.png)\n\nTeachable reached $10M ARR with 12,000 customers and an average revenue per customer (ARPU) of $67. These customers are supported by 64 full-time Teachable staff in New York City (4 in product, 15 in engineering, 16 in marketing, 21 customer operations, and 7 in finance, recruiting, and administrative).\n\nHow did Ankur Nagpal grow Teachable from 0 to $10M ARR in just four years? By architecting growth on the backend.\n\n# The Growth Model\n\nIn the early stages at $10k monthly recurring revenue (MRR), growth wasn't something the Teachable team was conscious about. They thought they'd just build a product that nailed product-market fit, serve their customers really well, and write blog posts. Their thinking was that it would be great if they grew, but it didn't need to happen.\n\nThey shifted from that mentality to making growth their core company value. Teachable made growth the priority, tried to leave as little to chance as possible, and took advantage of being small enough that they could strong-arm growth by doing things that didn't scale.\n\n[Andrew Guttormsen](https://twitter.com/AGuttormsen) - Teachable's head of growth - built Teachable's financial model of 30% MRR growth every month. Here's how Guttormsen's model played out for calculating how much recurring revenue Teachable would need to find for August 2015 (assuming a July MRR of $25,818, desired growth rate of 30%, and expected churn of 12%):\n\n```\nstarting_mrr           = $25,818\ngrowthRate             = 1.3\nexpected_churn         = 0.12\n\ndesired_mrr            = growthRate * starting_mrr\n                       = 1.3 * $25,818\n                       = $33,563\nexpected_churn_revenue = expected_churn * starting_mrr\n                       = 0.12 * $25,818\n                       = -$3,098\nneeded_mrr             = desired_mrr - starting_mrr + expected_churn_revenue\n                       = $33,563 - $25,818 - $3,098\n                       = $10,843\n```\n\nHere's that same model expressed as a Javascript function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction neededMRR(startingMRR, growthRate, revenueChurnRate) {\n  const desiredMRR = startingMRR * growthRate;\n  const expectedChurnRevenue = startingMRR * revenueChurnRate;\n  return desiredMRR - startingMRR + expectedChurnRevenue;\n}\n\nneededMRR(25818, 1.3, 0.12); // 10843.56\n```\n\nFor Teachable to have a \"successful\" August 2015, therefore, they had to find $10,843 in additional MRR.\n\nWhere does that $10,843 come from? That became the singular goal of the marketing and growth teams.\n\nThere were some expected sources of growth, like organic upgrades (roughly +$100/day for 30 days = +$3,000 MRR), weekly Thursday webinar workshops that all new signups were invited to (+$1,000 MRR each 4 times a month = +$4,000 MRR), and enterprise sales (+$1,000 MRR). Those known sources only account for `$3,000 + $4,000 + $1,000 = $8,000` of additional MRR of the needed $10,843, so they had to get creative to find the additional `$10,843 - $8,000 = $2,843`.\n\nWhere does the remaining $2,843 MRR come from? Part of deciding to make growth a top priority for Teachable was to be okay doing dumb things that didn't scale and could only work for one month. Perhaps this month they could host three extra influencer/partner webinars at an expected value of $1,000 MRR each. That extra $3,000 MRR could close the gap so Teachable could hit this month's growth target.\n\nThis is the process Teachable repeated every month. Early on, this \"needed MRR\" number was small enough to actually hit, and was a clarifying goal for the marketing and growth teams to focus on. \"Needed MRR\" was the single target focused on in meetings.\n\n<!-- Later on, the \"needed MRR\" number ballooned into a hundred thousand dollars, which is where their model broke down, but it drove growth into ??????. -->\n\n<!-- By targeting such a high number, they had to drive tactics that would have a shot in hell to hit the numbers. -->\n\n# Growing Growth Strategies\n\nAs MRR went up, the amount of extra MRR Teachable needed to find to maintain 30% growth increased proportionally. That put the Teachable team in the position of finding increasingly more tactics to drive up MRR.\n\nTheir general strategy was to take things that were already working, like one-on-one direct cold emails followed by personal sales calls (which could drive an extra $500-$1k MRR in a month pretty reliably) and scale them.\n\nBut what happens when you need to find another $2k in MRR? Instead of one-on-one personal sales calls, they could host a big webinar with _five to ten_ customers at the same time. This adapted strategy could now find an extra $1k-3k MRR.\n\nHow could Teachable scale up from that? They could schedule that webinar every _week_ instead of every month, so now a consistent $1k MRR was added every *week* for a total increase of $3k-5k MRR every month.\n\nHow could Teachable scale _that_ strategy? They could make each weekly webinar a joint venture with _influencers_ and capitalize on the influencer's existing audience, which translated to $5k-10k MRR every month.\n\nAt every stage, the necessity of having to discover a specific amount of revenue was the fuel behind Teachable's big growth innovations.\n\n# Growth Strategies\n\nThe necessity of \"finding revenue\" led to the discovery of some of Teachable's best growth strategies. Some - like scaling webinars - worked well, but there were many growth ideas that didn't work.\n\n**Growth Idea 1**: Try pitching customers a website with their content already uploaded to the Teachable platform so they can see exactly what it would look like if they switched to Teachable. In practice, people were creeped out that someone had pirated their content.\n\n**Growth Idea 2**: Try scraping all the people with courses on Udemy and send them a personal email. The first person that created a course on Udemy, however, was the founder of Udemy - Gagan Biyani.\n\n![Gagan Biyani - the founder of Udemy - responded politely to an automatically generated email asking if he'd be interested in switching from Udemy to Nagpal's teaching platform. #large](https://i.imgur.com/wX1jeJA.png)\n\n![Teachable Summit #small](https://i.imgur.com/fWf4jGb.jpg)\n\n**Growth Idea 3**: Instead of inviting partners one at a time, try aggregating several partners at once and have them all promote one big event they're all contributing to?\n\nThis strategy resembled a small online conference and worked really well. The first event generated $25k in new MRR, and repeated events generated $50k MRR.\n\n**Growth Idea 4**: Try raising the price of Basic plan from $29/month to $39/month and letting existing users claim the old price for a week before the price raise goes into effect.\n\nUsually in a prise increase, user lifetime values (LTVs) increase slowly. By offering the old price, Teachable generated a $20k new MRR spike in a week _and_ got the slowly increasing LTVs.\n\n# Growth Driven Vision\n\nBeing driven by revenue goals helped sanity check projects that would have been fun but wouldn't have driven growth.\n\nPulling this crazy growth out of nowhere month after month for 24 months had several secondary benefits:\n\n- Built momentum and morale internally - everyone wants to work on a “winning team”\n- Helped Teachable raise capital at terms we wanted because of \"traction\"\n- Growth begets growth - the bigger you get, the more your \"mini-brand\" grows\n\nIf Teachable failed to hit their growth, they could look at their growth model and see exactly why.\n\n![If Teachable failed to hit their growth goals, their growth model showed them why #large](https://i.imgur.com/vOcEVZo.png)\n\n# Where the Growth Model Breaks\n\n30% MRR growth isn't sustainable. After $500k MRR, 30% growth necessitates $180,000 of new MRR each month, even with decreased churn of 6%: `neededMRR(500000, 1.3, 0.06) == 180000`.\n\n<!-- ![Where the growth model breaks down](https://i.imgur.com/z7irlfb.png) -->\n\nEven if Teachable could earn $50k MRR by hosting a summit, they would be barely making a dent in the total number they needed to hit for the month. After a certain point, the strong arm method of growth stops working.\n\nHow did they grow after that point? By looking back to the product and customer.\n\n## Effective Growth 2.0 Strategies\n\nTeachable spent about 6 months after hitting $500k MRR trying to do one off activities to grow, but the model and strategies that got them to $500k MRR weren't working to grow further.\n\nAfter the $500k MRR inflection point, growth came most effectively from:\n\n1. Increasing new customers added per day,\n2. Decreasing churn rate, or\n3. Increasing average revenue per customer (ARPU).\n\nHere are some specific strategies Teachable used to move those three metrics.\n\n**1. Over hire for customer success**: During their scaling process, Teachable had as little as 1 Customer Care rep supporting every 1,000 paying customers. Today, that ratio is 1 to 600.\n\n![Customer metrics for Teachable improved dramatically by investing more in customer success, which reduced churn. #large](https://i.imgur.com/xSLEnjM.png)\n\nInvesting more in customer success also reduced churn. The difference between 5% and 6% churn at $500k MRR over 2 years is a $1.6M difference in ARR, which is enough to cover a payroll for **20-30 customer care agents**. Investing in customer success is worth it at this scale.\n\n![Teachable's redesigned one-page course checkout is easier to use and more effective. #small](https://i.imgur.com/GanI2QT.png)\n\n**2. Improve the checkout product**: If there's a part of your product that drives revenue, it makes sense to reinvest in improving that parts. For Teachable, that meant improving the course checkout page. Improving this page to a slick single flow with social proof increased course sales from $250k/day to $400k/day.\n\n![Making the $99/month plan more attractive changed the slope of Teachable's growth rate](https://i.imgur.com/WMtfnBr.png)\n\n**3. Charge more (kind of)**: Teachable's most popular plan used to be their cheapest $29/month plan. They put strategic effort towards making their second most expensive plan at $99/month the more attractive: they dropped all transaction fees for users on this plan and pulled most of the features from their most expensive $299/month plan into the $99/month plan.\n\nBy making their second most expensive plan more attractive, average customer revenue per paying customer (ARPU) jumped from $48/customer to $60/customer. ARPU has continued to compound to $67.\n\n# Questions\n\n**This seems to go against the advice of doing one thing well. How do you reconcile your one-off growth projects with that?**\n\n_We never found one strategy to grow that continued to work. There was no single channel we could focus on and still hit our numbers._\n\n**How many people did you have dedicated to growth at each stage?**\n\n_The growth team has never been smaller than 4 people, even at stage 1. In middle stages it was 4-8. Right now our growth team is like its own mini company (even with its own engineers) - about 16._\n\n**Should I focus on growth or product first?**\n\n_If we waited to grow until we felt really good about everything in our product, we would've never grown. Once you have some kind of product market fit, don't use product improvements as an excuse to not push on growth. You'll never feel like your product is ready._\n\nContact Ankur Nagpal on twitter at [@ankurnagpal](https://twitter.com/ankurnagpal).\n\n<iframe sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://lan.io/blog/podcast/ankur-nagpal/embed/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"700\" title=\"Rob Walling Recap Interview - Lanio\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\"></iframe>\n<script type='text/javascript'>const wp = document.querySelector(\".wp-embedded-content\"); window.addEventListener(\"message\", ({data, origin}) => {if(origin === \"https://lan.io\" && data && data.message === \"height\" && data.value) wp.height = data.value})</script>\n",

Why happy customers churn.\n2. What to focus on improving instead of customer happiness.\n3. What Docker, Fender Guitars, and Drip all did similarly to make their customers successful.\n\n# Anna Jacobsen\n\n![Anna Jacobsen skydiving](https://i.imgur.com/bDqNuoT.jpg)\n\nAnna Jacobsen is head of customer success and onboarding at [youcanbook.me](https://youcanbook.me). She's worked as head of customer success and in several other roles at [Drip](https://www.drip.com/).\n\nJacobsen has also been skydiving once.\n\nIn this talk, Jacobsen will be confronting fallacies she's noticed in customer retention - namely, that making customers happy increases customer retention - and how to build a better customer success strategy.\n\n# Happy Customers Aren't Loyal Customers\n\n<!-- \"Happy\" customers aren't loyal. -->\n\n![An excerpt from The Effortless Experience recommending to make customers happy.](https://i.imgur.com/MkZhS1H.png)\n\nPrevailing wisdom says that if you can make your customers happy, they'll be loyal. [The Effortless Experience](https://www.amazon.com/Effortless-Experience-Conquering-Battleground-Customer/dp/1591845815) states that making customers happy with memorable experiences leads to higher retention.\n\n![Prevailing wisdom of the relationship between customer happiness and retention is that retention (loyalty) goes up exponentially with increased customer happiness.](https://i.imgur.com/AIs2P2o.png)\n\nHowever, in practice, you can make a customer _delighted_, they can say really nice things about you, and they can still churn 6 months later.\n\nConversely, really angry customers that complain all the time in your support can stick around _forever_.\n\nWhy do unhappy customers stay, and why do happy customers leave?\n\nThe answer lies in a parallel field to customer relationships. [John Gottman](https://www.gottman.com/) studies married relationships and can predict with 90% accuracy if and when a couple will get divorced. His findings are rooted in the concept of \"good enough\" - if a person is unhappy in a marriage that's good enough, they're probably going to stay.\n\nPeople don't need to be _happy_ to stay in a relationship. If a person is getting their need met, they're likely to stay.\n\n![If a customer is getting their needs met by a \"good enough\" experience, they're nearly as likely to stay as if they were getting a delightful experience.](https://i.imgur.com/6f9oBws.png)\n\nAs in married relationships, customers are nearly as likely to stay even if they're unhappy as long as they're getting their need met.\n\nYou may love making customers happy. It can be an incredibly joyful experience. If you're bending over backwards to delight your customers, however, you're not being economical. Your time and attention would be better spent elsewhere on your business if your goal is to increase your customer retention.\n\nOnce you're consistently meeting the expectations of your customers, you're **already doing** the most economically viable thing you can do.\n\n# Great Products Don't Make Successful Customers\n\n<!-- There's a difference between **meeting the needs of the customer** and **delighting the customer**. By meeting your customer's needs, you're already doing the most economically viable thing you can do. -->\n\nWe'd like to think that if you build a great product, customers will love it. Here are three examples of great products that failed to help their customers be successful, and their strategies for achieving customer success.\n\n![Docker Training online program #small](https://i.imgur.com/j2Cntxh.png)\n\n## Example 1: Docker\n\nDocker went through a massive growth in 2014. Public job postings for engineers with Docker experience between 2014 and 2015 increased 17x from 2,500 to 43,000.\n\nThis massive growth in demand meant that companies that _wanted_ to use Docker couldn't. The product - Docker - was excellent, but companies couldn't get the support they needed to successfully use it.\n\nIn response, Docker developed [a free training program](https://success.docker.com/training) in late 2014 so engineers could get certified and meet the new demand. Docker adoption went up 40% the following year.\n\n![Fender Play guitar training app #small](https://i.imgur.com/kxE8NTK.jpg)\n\n## Example 2: Fender\n\nFender Guitars has been in a tough spot for the last decade. Ten years ago, they sold 1.5M guitars/year. Now, they're selling only 1M guitars/year - a 40% decrease. Additionally, the churn rate of guitar use within the first year is 90% (i.e.: there is a 90% probability that a guitar purchased today won't be in use one year from now).\n\nIn response, Fender developed Fender Play - a $10/month guitar education app focused on helping their customers successfully use their product. Note that Fender didn't change anything about their guitars, and didn't better advertise their guitar's features - Fender focused on helping their customers play the guitar.\n\n![Drip's Training Program #small](https://i.imgur.com/y0ym7Bn.png)\n\n## Example 3: Drip\n\nWhen Drip was acquired by Leadpages, they went from targeting a very specific type of customer to needing to cater to all of Leadpages' 43,000 customers. In response, Drip introduced a free plan that could be more accessible to more people.\n\nThese new free customers had a preexisting concept of email marketing (carried over from other free tools like Mailchimp) which they tried to apply to Drip. Customers complained that Drip was too complicated and heavy to use in the way they were used to.\n\nIn response, Drip developed a training program focused on teaching businesses the principles of marketing. In this weekly webinar and accompanying feature-based training program, Drip gave customers a framework to become their own consultant for email automation.\n\n## Strategy Training\n\nIn all three of these examples, the product (Docker, Fender Guitars, and Drip) was amazing, but customers needed more help to be successful. Each of these companies deployed training programs that met their customers at their need. These programs didn't teach customers about product features - they taught how to accomplish specific tasks.\n\nTSIA ran a survey on SaaS customers and found that this type of product and strategy training increased the percentage of customers able to use the product more by 68%, use more features by 56%, and work more independently by 87%.\n\n## Effective Adoption\n\nHow do we judge when someone has adopted your product? Adoption certainly doesn't happen when a user first signs up. It's not clear that a user has adopted your product even if they've set up certain features. High user activity in your app isn't even necessarily a marker for adoption.\n\nJust because someone uses your product does not mean they've been successful. They have to change their broken process too. You're the expert in the room, so take responsibility for your customer's success. Don't give up on them after they've paid you - share your expertise.\n\n<!-- These are all metrics of **effective adoption**. Don't ask if your customer is happy, measure how -->\n\n# 4 ways to take responsibility for your customer's success\n\nTaking responsibility for your customer's success is clearly a valuable goal, but what does that mean specifically? Jacobsen has four strategies to guide you.\n\n<!-- Too often, internal reports (upselling/cross selling rate, rate of feature adoption, churn rate, etc.) have nothing to do with customer success. -->\n\n## 1. Coach, don't sell\n\nWhat does a salesperson look like in your mind?\n\n![Two archetypes of a sales person #large](https://i.imgur.com/dADhpTw.jpg)\n\nThe stereotype of a salesperson is someone strongly financially driven to make as many and as large of sales as possible. On a call, this type of person would likely talk all about their product features and give you a compelling pitch for why you should choose them.\n\nHowever, being patient, present, attentive, compassionate, and prepared is a better sales strategy. On a call, this type of person would likely ask a lot of questions, listen thoughtfully to your responses, and genuinely help you solve your problem.\n\n## 2. Plan your customer's success\n\nCustomers are bad at planning their own success. Someone who buys a Fender guitar isn't going to plan out a practice schedule and graph their improving skill on their own.\n\nHelp your customer succeed by asking them what they're trying to do in your first conversation. Record their goals in a CRM and track how well they're achieving those goals.\n\nTracking customer success doesn't need to be complicated (in fact, it's better to be simple and consistent). You could just check back in with them the next time you interact and make sure they're accomplishing what they set out to do.\n\nHaving a record of a) what your customer wanted to do, and b) helping them achieve it makes upselling much easier when it's time for them to renew.\n\n<!-- Ex: [MailClark](https://mailclark.ai/) -->\n\n## 3. Map processes to features\n\nYour product features are meaningless to a customer until they know how to use them to improve an existing process.\n\nAs an example, Drip has a feature called [lead scoring](https://help.drip.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003731411-Lead-Scoring) that can find subscribers that are the best leads based on their level of engagement. This feature is super powerful but turned off by default because it needs to be set up specifically measuring what's important.\n\nA great salesperson for Drip would spend most of a sales call listening to what their customer was trying to achieve, and only at the end would they have the information needed to successfully set up lead scoring.\n\n## 4. Scale with Success Playbooks\n\nThe above three strategies work well but are very high touch. How could they consistently work at scale?\n\nSuccess playbooks are templates of how to reliably execute customer success strategies. Here's what that looks like for Drip (from Jacobsen's 2016 Microconf talk):\n\n![Drip's success playbook #large](https://i.imgur.com/mxNqFV8.png)\n\n1. A lead requests a demo and fills out a demo request with information about what problems they're trying to solve.\n2. If they're a high value lead, an internal sales development representative (SDR) opens a trial account and sets it up based on the demo request and company research.\n3. The Drip SDR demos the account to the lead.\n4. If the lead activates the demo account, they get put on a customer success plan managed by a customer success manager (CSM).\n5. If not, the lead gets automated followups that remind them to activate, then `GOTO 4`.\n\n# The Payoff: Renewal Time\n\nIf you've created a customer success plan and followed up to make sure your customer is continually succeeding (which puts you in more of the role of a consultant than a SaaS provider), you have more options for when it's time to renew.\n\nInstead of just sending them an email letting them know they're going to get a bill, or (if you're getting fancy) injecting some dynamic data showing how much value they got out of your product, you can use renewal as a moment to upsell based on specifically what value your customer is getting out of your product.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\n- Happy customers still churn\n- Our product probably isn't enough to get _all_ users to be successful\n- Focus on the needs of your customer, not delighting them. Don't be afraid to say \"no\" to two-hour calls for a $10/month customer so you can be freer to help higher valued customers to achieve their goals.\n- Be judicious with high touch customer service. Reserve it for people that give you a lot of money.\n\n# Questions\n\n**Do you have tips on getting users interested in demos, booked into demos, and then converted into customers?**\n\n_Look at how much stickiness you introduce in the trial phase._\n\n_To get people interested in demos, put the ability to book demos everywhere. Put a button to book a demo prominently on your site and include a link as a PS in your marketing emails._\n\n_You can't progress with us until you get educated. It's a requirement. \"It's been great talking with you - the next thing we'll do is schedule a time to talk about strategy. You're busy? That's fine - let's schedule a time later.\" If education is a major factor in if someone will adopt your product, don't let it be optional for your customer._\n\n_For converting, try to make it more sticky. If you have to extend their trial or set up integrations, go in and do that._\n\nIf you're having trouble scheduling meetings with your prospects and customers, or would like to chat about customer success, book Anna at [anna.youcanbook.me](https://anna.youcanbook.me).\n\n<iframe sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://lan.io/blog/podcast/anna-jacobsen/embed/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"700\" title=\"Rob Walling Recap Interview - Lanio\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\"></iframe>\n<script type='text/javascript'>const wp = document.querySelector(\".wp-embedded-content\"); window.addEventListener(\"message\", ({data, origin}) => {if(origin === \"https://lan.io\" && data && data.message === \"height\" && data.value) wp.height = data.value})</script>\n",

Manually find the first few guests\n2.  List places where interesting guests can be found (like other podcasts, communities, customers, etc.)\n3.

Parks used private equity money, corporate money, debt fund and bank financing.\n* 2010-2016: raised $5M for 4 early-stage companies with money from friends and family, angel investors, and venture capital.\n* 2017-Now: started [Bigfoot Capital](https://www.bigfootcap.com/) to capitalize early-stage software companies (4 so far) with money from HNW (accredited investors) and family offices.\n\nWhile these investors are all different in terms of how they invest, all investors have a common fear: **underperforming**.\n\nTo overcome this primal fear, investors need **comfort** from knowing that you're making good decisions with their money.\n\nYou can show early on in the investment process that you'd be good at making decisions with an investor's money by conducting yourself intelligently when raising money. This talk is about how to avoid common pitfalls of raising money.\n\nCheck out [Bigfoot Capital's Growth Edition Giveaways](https://www.bigfootcap.com/microconf-growth-edition-giveaways/) and reach Brian Parks at [calendly.com/bigfoot](https://calendly.com/bigfoot) or [bparks@bigfootcap.com](mailto:bparks@bigfootcap.com).\n\n# 6 Pitfalls to Avoid When Raising Money\n\nRaising capital is basically sales. If sales isn't your thing, find outside help!\n\nYou have processes for other parts of your business, so build one for raising money.\n\nInvestors are skeptical. Use the process to reduce their doubt.\n\n## Pitfall #1: Casually Raising Money\n\nIf you reach out to an investor asking for money, then don't follow up for another 90 days, the investor will question your commitment.\n\nIf you ask for help raising money from someone like Bigfoot Capital, put them to work! Ask for investor introductions, financial model reviews, and information about the investment process.\n\n## Pitfall #2:  Poor timing\n\nRaising money too early (before you've launched) is bad because it's much harder to iterate and learn. Instead, have conversations and build relationships with investors.\n\nDon't wait too long to get funding or you'll be in a distressed position and probably won't be happy with the deals available.\n\n## Pitfall #3: Going after the wrong audience\n\nIf your potential investor list is too big, your investors will question your targeting ability.\n\nBank financing only works if you're venture backed, and usually only works for smaller loans. Other investors might question your qualification ability.\n\n## Pitfall #4 : Having Unreal Expectations\n\nIf your investor list is too small (like 2 people), try broadening it to 30 or 50.\n\nIf your investment time window is too small, you'll lose steam (\"deal fatigue\").\n\nIf you overestimate your value, you'll shrink your market and turn groups off.\n\n## Pitfall #5 : Overoptimizing\n\n<!-- Overoptimizing feels like death by a thousand cuts. -->\n\nIf you're constantly renegotiating, good faith goes down the drain.\n\nIf you're overemphasizing edge cases, your judgment will be called into question.\n\nIf you can't get comfortable with a deal, your investors will start doubting their investment late in the game.\n\n## Pitfall #6:  Not thinking ahead\n\n<!-- It's easy to jeopardize future capital raises -->\n\nIf you only do what's comfortable, you'll get lazy and pay less attention. If you lock yourself by taking financing, you reduce optionality of taking future capital.\n",

    "body": "\nYou'll learn:\n\n1. Why recurring revenue and annual plans are overrated.\n2. How to make money charging *less*.\n3. Why your podcast player's settings are broken.\n\n# Chad Deshon\n\n![Definition of the word Microconfy](https://i.imgur.com/2tsjhyh.png)\n\nChad worked as a software engineer for 7 years and loved it, but wanted to do something more microconfy. He launched a B2B SaaS, charged more than he was comfortable with, and took sales calls with Fortune 500 companies.\n\nHis microconfy business - [BromBone](https://www.brombone.com/), a SaaS that helps serverless Javascript websites with SEO - worked really well! His business hit $20k MRR and Deshon's focus shifted to side projects.\n\nDeshon sold BromBone to do the exact opposite of a microconfy business: physical built-to-order board game tables shipped on semi trucks to board game enthusiasts.\n\n![BoardGameTables.com](https://i.imgur.com/9dCVBPj.jpg)\n\nBoardGameTables.com sells high end custom tables for an average of $3,500. Their June 2016 Kickstarter raised **$2.6M** (_\"I don't know about you but that's a lot of money where I'm from\"_).\n\nBoardGameTables is the anti-microconf business. This talk is about Chad Deshon's experience on what works well in BoardGameTables that goes against Microconf wisdom so you can think about your business from a different angle.\n\nContact Chad Deshon at [chad@boardgametables.com](mailto:chad@boardgametables.com).\n\n# 1. Recurring Revenue is Overrated\n\nRecurring revenue is overrated because it doesn't all recur - some of your users churn out every month and need to be replaced by new customers to keep revenue at the same level.\n\nAs you grow, your revenue will flatten out as your churn rate goes up and growth rate goes down (`growth_rate == churn_rate`). When churn equals growth, it's not the end of the world! Your business is still making money, it just isn't growing.\n\nInstead of looking only at recurring revenue as your financial metric for success, consider lifetime value (LTV) - the net profit you get over your entire relationship with a customer. For example, if you make $30/month from a customer that has an active account for 3 years, their LTV would equal `30 * 12 * 3 = 1080`.\n\nIn one-time sales, you get to collect all of a customer's LTV up front. If LTV is higher than the cost to acquire a customer (CAC) and the cost to give that customer what they ordered (fulfillment), then you make a profit (`profit = (LTV - CAC - fulfillment) * number_of_customers`), even though `growth_rate == churn_rate`.\n\nIn one-time sales you might not have customers lined up to pay you next month, but revenue is still predictable. How many tables are you going to sell in May? About the same as you sold in April! Your SEO and marketing engines are still working, so new customers will still be able to find you.\n\nAn advantage of recurring revenue is that it gives you more levers to influence LTV: decreasing churn or increasing expansion revenue (charging your existing customers more through upsells or cross-sells), but you pay for that advantage with delayed income and a harder sale.\n\nIn either of these models, charge your customers when you've delivered value to them.\n\n# 2. Annual Plans Are Overrated\n\nYou might be tempted to charge up front *and* get it spread out, but those are literally opposites. If you want to, you might be tempted to use annual plans.\n\nWhen Deshon sold BromBone through [FE International](https://feinternational.com/), he found that sellers wouldn't give him full credit in valuing his business for users on annual plans. Annual recurring revenue (ARR) is sometimes considered less valuable than monthly recurring revenue (MRR) because ARR can mask churning problems. If your software sucks, you can still retain them for a year!\n\nIt's much better longterm to fix churn at it's source: make your product consistently valuable to your best customers.\n\nOf course, there are benefits to having annual plans. Some customers are destined to churn (like customers that go out of business), so it would be better to get money from them upfront. Customers that go out of business are bad customers, though, and your path to growth isn't squeezing money out of your bad customers, it's making your product as valuable as possible to your great customers.\n\nIf you aren't restrained by cashflow, give serious pause before offering much of a discount for annual plans. Make sure you don't just offer annual plans because that's what everyone else is doing, and make sure you're not masking churn problems from yourself. A user on an annual plan has churned not when they stop paying you, but when they stop using your product.\n\n# 3. It is Possible to Move Down Market\n\nMoving down market is possible, and is different than charging less.\n\nWhen Deshon launched his Kickstarter for a new table at a lower price, the table was clearly **differentiated** (that's business speak for \"not as good\"). This cheaper table opened up new customers who were never going to buy the more expensive table.\n\nDeshon's high end tables lost some sales to cannibalization, but they also gained sales because of greater brand awareness.\n\nDon't start your business downmarket, but if you think you can launch a product that's 1) differentiated, 2) appealing to a new and larger audience, moving downmarket can grow your business with more work.\n\n# 4. Overrated: B2B = Just Show Positive ROI\n\nA big reason that people recommend starting a business-to-business (B2B) business is that if you can just show a positive return on investment (ROI) to customers then businesses will buy from you.\n\nFor example, if you sell a tool for $100/month that increases an ecommerce site's profit by $1,000/month, you can very easily sell ecommerce sites on your product. It's a no brainer.\n\nIn practice, B2C sales based on positive ROI aren't that straightforward. There are unknown costs in using a new product: setup expenses, opportunity costs, attribution problems (\"was that new revenue really because we're using your product, or would we have made that money anyway?\").\n\nBusiness-to-consumer (B2C) businesses, however, don't have to show a positive ROI. Consumers can buy things because just they're cool, not necessarily because they make the consumer more money.\n\n\"Look at this thing in the pretty picture. Do you want the thing in the pretty picture? Give me money and you can have the thing\" is a perfectly reasonable and reliable B2C sales process. The B2C sales process doesn't have to be logical.\n\nROI calculations are tricky, but people can want anything. Even in B2B sales, it's ultimately a *person* making the sales decision. If you can make the person in a business want your product, that desire can be more valuable than an ROI calculation.\n\n# 5. Listen to Podcasts at 1x\n\nSeriously. Relax. Take a deep breath. You don't have to cram information into your ears as fast as possible. Use the slower speed to allow your mind to wonder. To have its own ideas and go on its own tangents. It will be ok.\n",

    "body": "\nWhat is the Goal?\n\n* Validate an idea? Try flipping that to invalidating your idea.\n* Learn and adapt\n* Find product / market fit\n\nProduct / Market Fit\n\n* It is not just interest\n* True test is $$, but that's hard to get in the beginning\n* Look for a switch from you pushing to them pulling\n* See the user imagining their life with the product, and planning for it. That's a great sign.\n\nThings to Test and Adjust\n\n* Problem: what you're trying to solve.\n* Product: what you build to address it\n* Market: who you're selling it to, price point, the person you're selling to vs. person using it\n* Wording: use words your customers use.\n\nFinding People to Talk To\n\n* Your current network - don't ignore this! Just casually talk to friend about what you're trying to do. Does your uncle own a business in the space? Talk to them!\n* Become a visible expert in the space. Long term but great strategy. Meetups and blogs make it easier to find people.\n* Conferences / events / meetups. These are good, but make sure they're the places your users go to learn new things (\"watering holes\")\n* Cold emails. Keep it short and make it easy to respond. You can also find a way to personally connect, which increases the response rate (\"I'm also in Indy!\"), then **follow up**! \"Did you get my last email?\" => \"oh yeah, I meant to respond but I was busy\"\n\nConducting the Interview\n\n* In person > video > phone > email. Email is fine for a simple single response, but you get a lot of value from seeing a person's face.\n* Ask to record. It's going to go fast. Focus on engaging the person instead of collecting information.\n\nWhat NOT to Do\n\n* Don’t talk very much\n* Don’t put ideas in their heads. Try to get their wording.\n* Don’t describe your solution. This is hard. You can mention it at the end, but if you mention it too early you'll muddle up their words.\n* Don’t ask what they want. People don't know what they want!\n* Don't ask yes or no questions - \"does that sound like a good solution?\" cuts off information too soon. Change it to something like \"How does that problem rank among your day to day priorities\", or \"why might that work or not work for your business?\" \"Who are two or three other people who might be interested to talk about this?\" is harder not to answer than \"Do you know anyone else I could talk to?\"\n\nWhat to Ask About\n\n* Factual questions\n* Past behavior\n* How things operate now\n* What they don’t want\n* What they see others doing. The aspirational question! What do you want to be doing? These are words you can use in your marketing.\n\nDig In Deeper\n\n* Understand why. Ask “Interesting - tell me more about that.”, “... how does that work?”, “Describe how...”, “What was a time when...”. Get them talking about their process and try to understand why they operate.\n\nCompeting Products\n\n* Don’t despair - that’s good! Super valuable information\n* Ask what they like\n* Ask what they don’t like\n* “What would it take for you to switch?” This is a great question to mine for marketing language.\n\nAsk for Referrals. If you don't get one right away, say \"that's alright, I'll follow up in a few days\"\n\n* Warm leads respond MUCH better than cold leads. 5-10x better.\n* Doesn’t have to be on the call - say you’ll email later to ask\n* Can ask for an intro email\n\nAfter the Interview\n\n* Follow up! Prepare them with a “I’ll definitely let you know when I have more to show you.”\n* Make changes. There's no point to the interviews if you're not making any changes.\n* Do more interviews until you stop learning new things. Everyone wants a number - it's going to be different from market to market. 10 is easy to remember, but you actually want to keep going until you stop learning. Also, do interviews again after a few months! Maybe the market changed, maybe you have a bigger audience.\n\nCheck out [How to Run a User Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAws7eXItMk) and [How to Find Product Market Fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6pl5GG8RQ4)\n\n[Download Chris's slides](http://nanohop.com/mc18.pdf), and [email him](https://chris@nanohop.com) if you can't figure out who to email.

Why describing your product as \"powerful,\" \"fast,\" and \"easy-to-use\" is a huge mistake.\n2. What the Jobs-to-be-Done theory is, and how you can use it to create more effective positioning.\n3. A proven, step-by-step process for uncovering your customer's ultimate motivation (their \"job to be done\")\n\n# Indistinct Product Positioning\n\n![\"Powerful easy-to-use software that saves time and money\" is as indescript as a zebra in a zeal.](https://i.imgur.com/rcGPvpE.jpg)\n\n![Most appointment scheduling tools on Capterra interchangably describe themselves as \"powerful,\" \"time saving,\" and \"easy-to-use.\"](https://i.imgur.com/klUz8CL.jpg)\n\nIf you've ever described your product as:\n\n- Easy-to-use\n- Fast\n- Saves time/money\n- Powerful\n- Has a robust feature set\n\nyou're making a mistake. These descriptions are not only interchangable with your competitors, they're interchangable with completely different product categories.\n\nCustomers certainly want powerful easy-to-use software that's saving them time and money, but that description is too vague to make a decision on. If your positioning isn't more specific, customers won't know how you're better - or even different - than any other product in your category.\n\nYou might be able to strong-arm your way to $20-30k monthly recurring revenue (MRR) with generic product positioning, but it'll be hard to grow past that without being thoughtful about how you describe your product. Specific, vivid product positioning is especially important in crowded markets or if the cost of switching products is high.\n\n<!-- When marketing a product, it's common for founders to focus on the product itself. \"Look at our cool features! We help you do XYZ activity, but better!\" This is a recipe for getting lost in the noise, and for losing to competitors with deeper pockets. -->\n\n<!-- Instead, capturing your customer's attention requires focusing on her ultimate motivation (\"job to be done\"), which is to transform her current life-situation into a preferred one. -->\n\n<!-- There's a big problem with these generic descriptions: **They're abstract**: you wouldn't sell groceries as individual ingredients, you'd **sell the cake**. To capture people's imagination, you need to **get specific and vivid**. This is way more important if you're on a crowded market. -->\n\n# Product Positioning Case Study: YNAB\n\n![YNAB made a feature change that made it much harder to keep track of overspending, which is super stressful](https://i.imgur.com/vTPRR7J.jpg)\n\nSuellentrop and her husband Steven used the popular budgeting software [You Need a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (YNAB). They made particular use of a feature that let you overspend in a category. Overspending would carry a negative balance in that category to the following month without altering the rest of the budget.\n\nFor example: if Steven went on a business trip, he could overspend $1,000 in the \"business\" category for that month. The next month, YNAB would report that they had $1,000 to spend on groceries, $2,000 to spend on rent, $1,000 to spend on fun, and -$1,000 to spend on business. At the end of the year, Steven could easily prepare an expense report and get reimbursed for his business expenses. The negative \"business\" category balance could go back to zero.\n\nOne day, YNAB deployed an update that broke this use case. Instead of negative balances being contained to their category, they were subtracted proportionally from the total monthly budget. The month after a $1,000 business trip, the updated YNAB would report that they had $750 to spend on groceries, $1,500 to spend on rent, $750 to spend on fun, and $0 to spend on \"business.\"\n\nThis change made YNAB unusable for Suellentrop and her husband: it was harder to prepare the business expense report, and much more inconvenient to confidently manage their monthly budget. She started looking for alternatives.\n\n![YNAB, Tiller, and Quicken budgeting software have generic headlines.](https://i.imgur.com/ywrb1OB.jpg)\n\nYNAB's homepage product pitch is \"Gain Total Control of Your Money.\" Let's see how their competitors are positioning themselves:\n\n- [Tiller](https://www.tillerhq.com/): \"Ready to take control of your finances?\"\n- [Quicken](https://www.quicken.com/): \"Take control of your finances with Quicken\"\n\nSuellentrop has a very specific problem: she needs to be able to overspend in a budget category. \"Taking control\" of her finances isn't a problem she's trying to solve - she's already in control.\n\nBudgeting software companies look a lot like a zeal of zebras from their homepages.\n\nHow could YNAB, Tiller, and Quicken position themselves more vividly? The answer starts with a product development theory called Jobs to be Done.\n\n# Jobs-to-be-Done\n\nPeople buy and use your product because they want to make their own lives better. They don't care about your features or your product - they care about solving specific problems they have right now. They want to make themselves better in particular ways.\n\nThis observation led to the creation of a product development theory called Jobs-to-be-Done, which is detailed in [When Coffee & Kale Compete by Alan Klement](https://www.whencoffeeandkalecompete.com/).\n\nThis theory can be conceptualized as the story of a person encountering a **challenge**, finding a **solution**, and achieving a **better life**: `when ${challenge}, help me ${solution}, so I can ${betterLife}`.\n\n![Job story template: when ${challenge}, help me ${solution} so I can ${betterLife} #large](https://i.imgur.com/k9UXpGQ.png)\n\nFor Suellentrop YNAB case study, that Jobs-to-be-Done story template might be filled in as:\n\n- **When** my partner has made work-related purchases, and we know we'll be reimbursed for those purchases at the end of the quarter...\n- **help me** separate those purchases from the rest of our spending...\n- **so I can** plan next month's budget _without_ the stress of creating easy-to-screw-up workarounds.\n\n<!-- This specific use case isn't reflected on any of the general landing page copy of YNAB or any of their competitors. -->\n\nIs her story an edge case? Perhaps YNAB is intentionally broadly positioning themselves and knows their market better than Suellentrop does.\n\nLikely not. Googling \"YNAB alternatives\" brings up several active Reddit posts of people struggling with similar specific problems (and - notably - no adword campaigns or competitor landing pages):\n\n- [\"my finances have been a mess because I can't grasp the new software\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/7x4nan/simple_ynab_4_alternatives/)\n- [\"new features are pretty useless, and sometime actually interfere with my usage\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/7ea6zo/ynab_alternatives_rant/)\n- [\"YNAB isn't for me...I'm accidentally stealing from the future\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/6zmrod/realistic_alternatives_to_nynab/)\n- [\"YNAB Alternatives\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/7d6aj6/ynab_alternatives/)\n\nEach of these posts have tens of comments and hundreds of upvotes, which means they likely have tens-of-thousands of people with similar problems. If you were a competitor to YNAB, think of how effective it would be to take these words and use them on your landing page!\n\n![Changing the headline copy on this budgeting software's homepage from \"Ready to take control of your finances?\" to the more specific \"The only way to fully customize the way you manage your money, painlessly\" had a 200% increase in conversions to the pricing page #large](https://i.imgur.com/IDNuGal.jpg)\n\nHaving more specific product positioning is clearly valuable, and the Jobs-to-be-Done framework is a great way to conceptualize a job, but how can you figure out the job your product does for your customers? Suellentrop has two recommendations for getting this information from your users: surveys and interviews.\n\n# Customer Surveys\n\nSurveys are most effective when you have a sizable customer base you can pull from. Wait to conduct surveys until you have a few hundred customers.\n\nFirst, create a form with [Jotform](https://www.jotform.com/), [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) (Suellentrop's favorite), or another survey tool that allows hidden fields.\n\nFill in the form welcome screen with something like: _We really appreciate you sharing your experience with ${product}! We know you're super busy, so we promise to only ask a few key questions. This should take less than 4 minutes to complete._\n\nKeep your survey short. The longer your survey, the less likely you'll get high quality answers. Here's an example:\n\n1. `challenge`: _When did you realize you needed something like ${product}? What was going on in your world that caused you to start looking for something new?_\n2. _How did you find out about ${product}?_\n3. `solution`: _Why did you decide to choose us over other options? Can you recall if anything in particular appealed or stood out to you?_\n4. `solution`: _When you signed up for ${product}, what happened that made you feel certain it was right for you?_\n5. `betterLife`: _Now that you have ${product}, what's the #1 thing you're able to do that you weren't before?_\n\n![Customer survey responses will fill in a customer's `challenge`, `solution`, and `betterLife` for their Jobs-to-be-Done story. #large](https://i.imgur.com/5hI2YoU.png)\n\nNext, highlight a list of 100-200 of your most high-value customers. \"High-value\" is context dependent, and usually means customers are on high paying plans and are engaged in the product.\n\nHold back about 40 of the customers on this list to reach out to for interviews in the next step. You don't want to exhaust them with a survey _and_ an interview in a short amount of time.\n\nOnce your list and survey are prepared, send out an invitation for your customers to take the survey. Here's an example survey invitation email:\n\n_Subject: Could you help us out?_\n\n_Hi `${name}`,_\n\n_Hope you're doing well!_\n\n_We have a few questions we're hoping we could ask you, so we can better understand what matters most to our awesome customers (like you)!_\n\n_It shouldn't take more than 4 minutes of your time._\n\n_Think you could you help us out? If so, we'd love to get your input here: `${surveyLink}`._\n\n_Cheers!_\n\n_`${yourName}`, `${yourTitle}` `${company}`_\n\nInclude a hidden field in the `surveyLink` that automatically adds the respondent's name or email address in their form submission. Once you begin analyzing your results, you may need extra contextual information that customers don't directly state in their replies (e.g.: the type of company they work for, their industry, and their job title). If you have the respondent's name or email, you can check these details in your CRM, customer database, or on LinkedIn. Here's Typeform's guide on emailing survey links with hidden fields: [Hidden fields: How to populate the variable with a CRM / Marketing Automation tool](https://www.typeform.com/help/hidden-fields-populate-variable-crm/)\n\nExpect to get 25-50 responses from a list of 100-200 customers. While your survey results are rolling in, you can get started setting up customer interviews in the next step.\n\n# Customer Interviews\n\nYou may feel hesitant to asking your customers for interviews because you don't want to annoy them, but people love getting on this call and talking about themselves.\n\nInvite the 40 held-back high-value customers to a 30-minute interview with a link to schedule. In your email, express \"hey, I'd love to learn more about you, how you're using the product, what's working, and what's not. No pressure - I'd just like to learn from you.\"\n\nHere's an example:\n\n_Subject: Could you help us out?_\n\n_Hey there `${name}`,_\n\n_I'm reaching out to a few of our power users to get a stronger sense for how people like you are using `${product}`._\n\n_Any chance you'd be up for sharing your experiences using `${product}`? It'd be an easy 30-minute chat. No trick questions :)_\n\n_If so, feel welcome to name the easiest time here, and I'll give you a call then: `${schedulingToolLink}`_\n\n_Thanks so much!_\n\n_`${yourName}`, `${yourTitle}` `${company}`_\n\nYou'll probably get a 20-25% conversion rate to booking a time. Not every scheduled meeting will go through - people don't always show up. Aim to conduct at least 10 interviews for enough data to work with in the next step.\n\nBefore the interview, set up a way to record the call. **Don't rely on taking notes.** Raw language straight from your customer's mouth is amazing material for developing stronger positioning. You'll use transcripts of the recordings to mirror your customer's language back at them. You can use [rev.com](https://rev.com) to transcribe the audio files for $1/minute.\n\n## Conducting the interview\n\nWhen you're interviewing a customer, don't ask for product feedback (ex: _\"what do you think of this feature?\", \"would you use a feature like this?\"_). People are bad at answering questions like that. If you ask about your product, you'll just get their opinion (which isn't useful).\n\nInstead, try to uncover **why** they made decisions that led them to using your product. Ask [open ended](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/open-ended-questions/) questions that prompt people to answer with sentences, lists, and stories (ex: not _\"does `${product}` fit into the work you do?\"_, but _\"how does `${product}` fit into the work you do?\"_).\n\nFirst, get some context for your conversation. Ask questions that answer who this person is, what they do, and a rough sketch of the problem your product is solving for them:\n\n- _What's your job title - and beyond that, your role at your company?_\n- _How does `${product}` fit into the work you do?_\n- _Walk me through your most common workflows. Where within them is `${product}` used? With which other products/platforms?_\n\nNext, ask questions to understand what their life looked like before using your product. Their answers to these questions will be used later to fill out the `challenge` variable of their Jobs-to-be-Done story:\n\n- _So, let's take a step back. What tools were you using to `${task}` before `${product}`?_\n- _If you weren't using any other tools, how did you typically `${task}`?_\n- _Tell me about that. What worked well, and what didn't?_\n\nNext, ask questions to understand what specific event happened that motivated them to start seeking a solution to their struggle, and what they envisioned as a solution (this may fill in their `challenge` or `betterLife`):\n\n- _What was going on in your world that compelled you to look for something different?_\n- _How did you envision life being better once you'd found a new solution?_\n\nAfter that, ask questions to understand their process for searching for solutions, how they found your product, and how they decided to try and ultimately purchase your product (their `solution`):\n\n- _Once you figured out you wanted to make a change, how much research did you do to find the right solution for `${customerCompany}`?_\n- _What were some of the other tools you tried?_\n- _Do you recall how you found them?_\n- _How did `${product}` come into the picture?_\n- _What made you interested in trying it?_\n- _Were you the only one on your team looking for something else at the time?_\n- _What happened when you tried `${product}` that convinced you it was the right choice?_\n- _What were you skeptical of / concerned about during the trial process?_\n\nFinally, ask questions to understand specifically how their life is better with your solution (their `betterLife`):\n\n- _Now that you're using `${product}` regularly, what are you able to do that you weren't before?_\n- _What features could you not live without?_\n- _How do those features make your life better?_\n- _Tell me about a time when you got surprising results or found unexpected value._\n- _As `${customerTitle}`, how has `${product}` changed the way your team works?_\n- _How has that impacted your team's goals or performance?_\n- _Can you think of any concrete examples of times this has happened?_\n- _What's the big problem `${product}` solves?_\n\nOnce your conversation is over, upload the audio recording to [rev.com](https://rev.com) to get it transcribed.\n\n# Distilling Research Data\n\n<!-- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLwwkC5dMS_V39moHtAhlWyV7KmEi7qNjbAOQS4Xtq4/edit?__s=qsn3ienq4ahjsoqbk46b# -->\n\n![When you have your own customer's words, writing copy is trivial](https://i.imgur.com/JUK1wFT.jpg)\n\n![An example of organized `challenge` data for a stock photo website. Green is swipe-able copy, blue is interesting channel ideas, and red is interesting content ideas.](https://i.imgur.com/cPyAx0t.png)\n\nAt this point, you'll have 25-50 survey responses and at least 10 several-page-long interview transcripts. These responses and transcriptions contain a ton of qualitative data to fill in the `challenge`, `solution`, and `betterLife` to tell Jobs-to-be-Done stories of people encountering a **challenge**, finding a **solution**, and achieving a **better life** (`when ${challenge}, help me ${solution}, so I can ${betterLife}`).\n\n<!-- What are our highest value customers doing before they felt a struggle? What is the struggle? If you can speak directly to it, you can write copy that convinces potential customers that you get them. -->\n\nGo through this data looking for trends and patterns. Pull out particularly sticky quotes into these categories:\n\n- `challenge`: Most common events/situations that caused a struggle in customers' lives\n- How customers found us\n- `solution`: Top differentiators that set us apart\n- `solution`: \"Aha!\" moments that prompted purchase\n- `betterLife`: The \"better life\" our customers have achieved\n- Final interesting notes / miscellaneous swipe-able copy\n\nWith this organized data, you won't have to make up your product positioning off the top of your head. You'll be able to position your product with your customer's own language.\n\n# Questions\n\n**How can you make copy more specific on your home page if you have a lot of verticals you're targeting? Should we focus on just a few high-value verticals? Should we have landing pages for each vertical?**\n\n_Your homepage is like an Airport: some people want pricing, some want jobs, some are already using your product want to contact support._\n\n_Having landing pages for each type of person that could be on your home page is a great move. You could have an easy way for users to segment themselves, like how [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) used to have two tabs on their homepage with two different value propositions to segment agency owners vs. business owners._\n\n_If people can self-select on their homepage you can speak to people more strongly. Your goal with your homepage should be to segment out your different verticals so you can speak to people more specifically as quickly as you can._\n\nNote from Christian: also check out [Right Message](https://rightmessage.com/).\n\n**When choosing the ~200 high value customers, can you contact them right after they've signed up, or should you give them time to settle into your product?**\n\n_Aim to interview and survey the people who have been in your product for a while. \"A while\" is dependent on your product, and the rule of thumb is 6 months. It depends on what getting onboarded means for your product._\n\n_People who have spent some time in your product will have the best information on how life is better now._\n\nContact Claire Suellentrop on twitter [@ClaireSuellen](https://twitter.com/ClaireSuellen) or [@Userlistio](https://twitter.com/Userlistio).\n\n<iframe sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://lan.io/blog/podcast/claire-suellentrop/embed/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"700\" title=\"Rob Walling Recap Interview - Lanio\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\"></iframe>\n<script type='text/javascript'>const wp = document.querySelector(\".wp-embedded-content\"); window.addEventListener(\"message\", ({data, origin}) => {if(origin === \"https://lan.io\" && data && data.message === \"height\" && data.value) wp.height = data.value})</script>\n",

Each is a metaphor for a phase of your startup. #small](https://i.imgur.com/SmSo0KX.png)\n\nIn this recap, you'll learn to avoid some common mistakes the founders he's talked to have made through four mental models of startup success: the Startup Runway, the El Dorado of Ideas, the Climbing Wall of Growth, and Vision.\n\n# 1. The Startup Runway (of almost certain death)\n\n![#small](https://i.imgur.com/DGqVXk0.jpg)\n\nThe Startup Runway is a representation of how much money you have left and how much time you have until your business is dead.\n\nNavigating the Startup Runway is simple: become cashflow positive before you run out of money.\n\nHow? In theory, the same way a pilot would navigate an actual runway. Keep your eyes on the end of the runway so you know how long you have left, study the capabilities of your \"plane\" so you know what it's capable of, and plan for a little extra buffer in case something goes wrong.\n\nIn practice, this isn't how it always works out. Let's talk about some real world examples.\n\n![#small](https://i.imgur.com/5Kh54uP.png)\n\n## Exhibit 1: Courtland Allen's 2009 Startup\n\nCourtland won $25k in a business competition, which gave him a year of runway to build his startup in Boston. He spent the next year writing a lot of code and landing pages.\n\nEleven months in, Courtland launched his product but never charged his customers money. His startup failed because he ran out of money the next month.\n\nCourtland's mistake was not keeping an eye on his runway. If he had calculated how much runway he had left, it would've become clear earlier that he needed to get money sooner.\n\n![Chris Chen #small](https://i.imgur.com/SGX8bLH.png)\n\n## Exhibit 2: Chris Chen of Instapainting\n\nChris got a $110k loan for that gave him an impressive 3-year runway. Having a long runway meant he could try out many ideas and pivot if they weren't working.\n\nAfter three years of pivoting, he ran out of cash. He moved entirely out of the social music app space and looked for an idea that could generate revenue immediately.\n\n$4,000 in debt, he created, tested, and launched [Instapainting](https://www.instapainting.com/) in a few days. In two weeks, he'd made $2,000 in sales. Check out Chris's full story on the [Indie Hackers Podcast Episode #002](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/002-chris-chen-of-instapainting).\n\n## Exhibit 3: Max Lytvyn of Grammarly\n\n![Max Lytvyn #small](https://i.imgur.com/a793MFu.png)\n\nBefore Max Lytvyn started building [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) he'd already successfully built a company, which gave him experience calculating runway.\n\nWith this experience, Max knew if he built an MVP without any customers lined up, Grammarly would run out of money.\n\nBecause Max had a good understanding of what it would take to launch Grammarly, he could try selling to institutions, organizations, and individuals at the same time while developing the product.\n\nAs soon as the first version of Grammarly was finished, Max had a pipeline of organizational buyers lined up. Grammarly became profitable in less than six months. Check out Max's full story on the [Indie Hackers Podcast Episode #045](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/045-max-lytvyn-of-grammarly).\n\n![The Helicopter Pad of Certain Slow Success vs. the Runway of Certain Death.](https://i.imgur.com/uaN9QEx.png)\n\n## Alternative: The Helicopter Pad of Certain Slow Success\n\nInstead of navigating the runway of certain death, you can use a helicopter! 🚁\n\nThe Helicopter Pad of Certain Slow Success uses the same money-and-time-management skill set as the Runway of Certain Death, but is much safer and simpler.\n\nThis metaphor is about burning through cash. If you don't want to burn through cash, don't quit your job! By keeping a stream of income, you don't need to be worried about running out of runway.\n\nIf you don't think you have enough time to work on your startup without going in full time, you can change the scope of your startup to be more achievable in the time you have.\n\n# Landscape 2: The El Dorado of Ideas\n\n![A beautiful Trello board of ideas the Indie Hacker member had put together.](https://i.imgur.com/bNxQHXX.png)\n\nIn April of 2018, an Indie Hacker member posted that after a year of looking for an idea, they had achieved nothing but a Trello board of ideas.\n\nSome of their ideas were bad, and the good ones were good but obvious - people were already working on them and already had established businesses making money.\n\nThere's a conception that coming up with ideas isn't something you can force, and that good ideas require inspiration and luck. Coming up with ideas, though, is a core skill in running a business. How do you build an audience? Launch successfully? Find new customer segments? Through the life of your company, you'll need to have the ability to come up with ideas. Treat ideation as a skill you can develop.\n\n![The El Dorado of Ideas.](https://i.imgur.com/AQvGo8T.jpg)\n\nTo develop this skill, think about the set of ideas you could discover as a landscape of golden nuggets: The El Dorado of Ideas. Thousands of people are walking around looking for obvious golden nugget ideas to work on. The chances you'll find obvious gold that no one else has already picked up are tiny. This isn't a great strategy.\n\nAnother potential strategy would be digging lots of shallow holes: try building a quick landing page for a new idea every day and see what gets traction! You're more likely to find nonobvious gold than if you hadn't dug at all, but if you're not doing any deep-digging research you still won't find gold.\n\nThe best strategy for navigating The El Dorado of Ideas is to dig deep instead of wide.\n\n![Dig deep and get your hands dirty to find valuable ideas. Even if it doesn't work the first time, you'll have a skill set to dig deep again.](https://i.imgur.com/OqyhCUO.png)\n\nDigging deep means asking questions like:\n\n- Who are these people?\n- Where do they hang out?\n- What do they complain about?\n- What makes them really excited?\n- What do they buy? What do they never buy?\n- Who do they follow, trust, and respect?\n- What do they fear?\n- What are their goals?\n- What do they actually care about?\n- Where do they get their product recommendations?\n- What do they read, watch, or listen to?\n- What makes them angry?\n\nYou'll start finding ideas nobody else has found because not many people dig deep for good ideas.\n\nIf you have a new idea, dig deep again! Don't build your house over what you _think_ is a goldmine without proof. Go back to El Dorado and dig deep. Successful multibillion dollar companies like Stripe don't just use their intuition - they talk to customers a lot.\n\nHow do you decide where to start digging deep? Start where the money is at. Look for places where lots of money is changing hands.\n\nAlso ask:\n\n- Are the customers reachable?\n- How long would it take to launch a product?\n- What are your weaknesses?\n- What's your runway like?\n- Would you like your customers?\n- What are your personal goals?\n- What industry would make you happy?\n\nWherever you dig, it'll determine the next five years of your life. Decide what's important to you and put some thought into what it would look like if you actually hit gold, and if you'd be in a place you actually want to be. Don't start a business that needs a lot of customer support if you hate customer support.\n\nFor more on the specifics of how to \"dig deep,\" check out Amy Hoy's Sales Safari technique at [Stacking the Bricks](https://stackingthebricks.com/).\n\n# Landscape 3: The Climbing Wall of Growth\n\n![Hotmail, AirBnB, Yelp, and Dropbox all have simple romanticized stories about the one simple growth hack they implemented that got them hockey stick growth. It's a lie.](https://i.imgur.com/DocjfRT.png)\n\nMost beginner founders think growth happens explosively followed by smooth sailing to the top. This is the simple story successful companies tell about their history, but it's not true.\n\nOne out of a million company might have a successful growth hack, but it won't be your company. Growth isn't a rocket ship sail boat - it's a climbing wall.\n\n![Growth is more like a climbing wall than a rocket ship.](https://i.imgur.com/e8PWSgZ.jpg)\n\nAt the bottom of a climbing wall there is no magical viral growth cheat code that instantly launches you to the top. Climbing is hard, and it's hard all the way up. Every step takes effort and attention. If you stop climbing, you stop progressing.\n\nDon't waste time looking for the perfect first step. Just get started with a simple first step.\n\nOnce you've taken a small step, you'll have new steps accessible that you couldn't reach from the ground and you can reevaluate the next step to take from there.\n\nYou don't need a brilliant perfect strategy before you start. Nobody else jumped straight to the top. You'll never find new steps unless you try - just keep climbing.\n\nIf you feel stuck, look for paths others took. You can look multiple steps ahead at what's working for other people on your path. Knowing that a full mailing list will be useful a few steps ahead makes it clear that starting a mailing list now is useful.\n\nTo prevent getting sidetracked, set a destination. Climbing higher means you'll open more potential opportunities. Knowing where you're trying to go means it'll be easier to say \"no\" to things that don't bring you closer to your destination.\n\n![Jason Grishkoff #small](https://i.imgur.com/CpuuNpz.jpg)\n\n## Exhibit 4: Jason Grishkoff of SubmitHub\n\nJason Grishkoff started a music blog, [IndieShuffle](https://www.indieshuffle.com/), in 2009. For seven years Jason curated indie music and grew this blog to hundreds of thousands of visitors per day.\n\nHe started getting hundreds of pitches every day from musicians asking to have their music featured on his blog. To deal with these emails, Jason created the first version of [SubmitHub](https://www.submithub.com/) so musicians could send him their music to review for a small fee. A few years later, SubmitHub was making six figures every month.\n\nSimplifying this story makes it seem like Jason's business was a smooth sailing rocket ship. When he first published his story, Indie Hacker readers complained that Jason had it too easy because he already had a successful blog, and that they couldn't learn anything from his story.\n\nJason's full story on the [Indie Hackers Podcast Episode #001](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/001-jason-grishkoff-of-submithub) more accurately depicts the complex climbing wall of growth Jason went through. His growth wasn't as easy as it looked. It was a long hard slow slog, even with a huge audience:\n\n\"I hand tailored more than 1,000 emails to blogs. It took me five months of doing it every day. They didn't respond, so I would tweet them, I would Facebook message them, I'd send SoundCloud messages, I'd send another email. Then I'd try and find another contact. And we're still sort of doing this today. Those 250 blogs and labels didn't come overnight.\"\n\nEven once SubmitHub was off the ground, Jason had challenges in getting labels and YouTube channels to sign up, working with other music blogs, tuning artist submissions. Each step in growth was a new unique problem. It took Jason eight months from launching SubmitHub to make his first dollar, and two years after launching to reach the impressive numbers he's at today.\n\n# Landscape 4: Living Room of Vision\n\nEven if you don't have employees, having a vision is still important. The most likely threat to your business dying is that you get discouraged and quit working on it. How can you stay confident?\n\n![Courtland's living room, which may have a $3M diamond lost in it.](https://i.imgur.com/PqvC2QN.jpg)\n\nIf you knew Courtland lost a multimillion dollar diamond in his apartment, how long would you spend looking for it? Hours? Days? Weeks? If you were confident there was a $3M diamond somewhere in his apartment, you'd probably stay motivated to look for it for years.\n\nFounders that have high confidence in the vision of their business try much harder because they feel confident their effort isn't being wasted. They're systematically ruling out places where their metaphorical multimillion dollar diamond _isn't_.\n\nIf Courtland said there \"may or may not\" be a $3M dollar diamond in his apartment, you'd probably give up a lot easier. If you're less confident in the outcome, _of course_ you'll give up when the work get hard.\n\nThe IndieHackers mission is to \"inspire people to create internet businesses and to help these new founders succeed at a scale large enough to have a global impact\" - that's a mission that can keep Courtland motivated for years.\n\n# Questions\n\n**Apart from content marketing, are there others ways to get early traction?**\n\n_It depends a lot on your target customers. Everyone knows about the default places to launch, like Hacker News and Product Hunt, but that's all most people know about._\n\n_Is your audience indie game developers? Spend a lot of time with them. Learn what influencers they care about, where they hang out online (Amy Hoy's \"watering holes\"), and where they get their news._\n\n_Google is a great channel, but every customer segment has its own places online where they get new content._\n\n**How do you set your goal? How do you know where the top of the climbing wall is?**\n\n_I had this issue with Indie Hackers. We were focused on how we could grow, but didn't know where we wanted to be in two years._\n\n_You get to decide your own vision. Make it something you can be confident in, and something you want._\n",

He's the founder of [SoftwarePromotions](https://www.softwarepromotions.com/) - an agency for improving website Search Engine Optimization (SEO) based in the UK. Collins has been working in the online software industry since 1997 and has an unhealthy obsession with data and trends.\n\nHe's \"an awful rock climber, amateur photographer and a slave to his wonderful children.\"\n\n# Search Engine Optimization isn't Dead\n\n![There's a popular conception that SEO is dead.](https://i.imgur.com/X80QsXp.jpg)\n\n<!-- ![\"places to visit in las vegas\" Google search results show only one organic result on the first page, and several powered by organic results](https://i.imgur.com/ONPY0rS.jpg) -->\n\n<!-- ![\"good restaurants in las vegas\" shows mostly organic content](https://i.imgur.com/D5NVYhX.png) -->\n\n![\"where to buy euros\" Google search results don't answer where to buy euros. Many obvious SEO opportunities still exist.](https://i.imgur.com/dJAOTo6.png)\n\nOptimizing for search engine optimization (SEO) usually isn't a focus of online businesses. SEO work is boring, non-urgent, time consuming, unlikely to work, and could blow up in your face if you do it incorrectly.\n\nAdditionally, there's a popular conception that SEO is dead and doesn't work anymore.\n\nThe people saying SEO is dead are wrong, and likely optimizing incorrectly. If you completely ignore SEO, you have a risk of destroying your business.\n\nIn this talk, Collins guarantees (\"kind of\") to present a method of SEO that's easy, quick, effective, and won't blow up in your face.\n\nHe'll be covering some fundamentals of SEO, so you may still find it boring.\n\n<!-- # SEO History and Fundamentals -->\n\n<!-- the web used to be just text; google has become a verb. kids don't know they're using google -->\n\n<!-- People like to point to ads on google search results and say search results are all about paid ads, but most google real estate is actually there for organic results. -->\n\n# Testing Google's Intelligence\n\n![Google image searching \"black and white jack russell smiling next to a baby\" returns only two valid results.](https://i.imgur.com/zaJihRF.jpg)\n\n![\"Visually similar\" images to Dave Collins' profile picture are actually just matching page metadata.](https://i.imgur.com/OOPCNFT.jpg)\n\nLet's test Google's ability to return valid search results.\n\nTODO: why?\n\nSearching for [\"dog\"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=dog), [\"jack russell\"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=jack+russell), and even [\"jack russell smiling\"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=jack+russell+smiling) yield excellent and accurate results.\n\nSearching for any more specific queries quickly degrades the quality of results, though. [\"black and white jack russell smiling\"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=black+and+white+jack+russell+smiling) confuses Google: are you looking for black and white _pictures_, or black and white _jack russells_? Several of the results aren't black and white _or_ jack russells.\n\nOne step of specificity beyond that, and we've stepped outside of the sphere of Google's expertise. [\"black and white jack russell smiling next to a baby\"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=black+and+white+jack+russell+smiling+next+to+a+baby) has _maybe_ one relevant result on the first page. Once you've broken through the barrier of Google's ability, they don't know what they're doing, and they need help.\n\nSimilarly, reverse google image searching for a photo of Dave Collins returns several results that aren't at all visually similar, but are on pages that match \"Dave Collins\" in the metadata. Google isn't yet capable of magic - their results are still based primarily on text.\n\nThe fore fundamentals of SEO haven't changed at all in the last 20 years. Google needs our help - it's a partnership.\n\n# SEO Action Plan\n\n## Task 1: Low Hanging Fruit\n\nHow will google feel about bland meaningless copy, like \"websites are becoming more and more common every day\"? Bleh.\n\nHere's the low hanging fruit.\n\n> \"Low hanging fruit,\" as you Americans like to say. Low hanging fruit? Low hanging fruit.\n\n[Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) has four important parts you should be checking on a regular basis:\n\n1.  Crawl Errors: anything google finds that causes a problem, like a 404. This is bad for google and you.\n2.  HTML improvements: massively underestimated. Highlighted in [Google's search engine optimization starter guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en)\n3.  Index Status: select all the boxes and make sure everything makes sense.\n4.  Security issues: should always read \"we haven't detected any security issues with your site's content\". If not, stop everything and fix it.\n\n## Task 2: Keywords\n\n1.  How would your friend describe your page?\n2.  Run these phrases through google - would your page make sense in this context?\n3.  Use your imagination!\n\nIf you were looking for microconf, would you search for \"conference for startups\", \"entrepreneurial conference\", or \"entrepreneur conference\"?\n\nTurns out \"entrepreneurial conference\" has the highest search volume!\n\nHere's another example:\n\n- seo service (1x)\n- **seo services (6x)**\n- seo training\n- seo is dead\n\nYou have to use the tools, don't just guess what you think the most popular keywords are.\n\n> People click on more compelling titles\n\n## Task 3: More compelling content\n\nIf you have more than 10-15 pages of content, you don't need to write new content purely for SEO. It's more about making better use of what you have.\n\nTODO: see low hanging fruit in spreadsheet?\n\nWhat do people also ask? Reflect these ideas back at google!\n\n![What do people also ask? Reflect these ideas back at google!](https://i.imgur.com/foA2Lms.png)\n\nSee the world as google sees it. You can also use tools like [ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/).\n\nGet into the minds of the people searching. Look at the pain points, ideas, and themes of people searching for your stuff.\n\n## Task 4: Use the Right Tools Correctly\n\n- [Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/#?modal_active=none): useless from an SEO perspective because they round up all the figures. It's misleading.\n- [Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console): more data than most paid SEO tools (this is free)\n- [ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/): 7-day trial for $7\n- [Screamingfrog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/): desktop based software for scraping websites\n- [Sitebulb](https://sitebulb.com/):\n- [urlprofiler](https://urlprofiler.com/)\n\nThese tools wont' do the work for you, though\n\n## Task 5: Feed the mobile index\n\nGoogle is moving to mobile-first indexing. Your index will be based on the mobile version of your website.\n\n[Rolling out mobile-first indexing](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/03/rolling-out-mobile-first-indexing.html) has quadrouple speak, but basically says Google will care a lot more about mobile indexes.\n\nResponsive is not mobile-friendly. Check if your site is actually mobile friendly with Google's [Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)\n\n## Bonus Tip\n\n> Golden Rule: Put humans before spiders. Always\n\nIf you click on a website and get a page with a bunch of SEO nonsense, you're going to bounce, which is a super strong indicator your site sucks.\n\n## 7 Rules of SEO\n\n1.  Don't talk about SEO\n2.  Fix the machine: don't just look good, work well\n3.  Invest time in keywords\n4.  A different approach to content\n5.  Use the right tools\n6.  Embrace mobile first ([check your website](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)). If you pass, Dave will let you buy him a drink.\n7.  Humans before spiders.\n\nEvery once in a while, one of these seeds will fall in the right place and build something amazing.\n\n# Questions\n\n**When google gets a 404 on one of your page, how do you tell Google it's gone? A redirect?**\n\n_Redirect removed URLs to the closest fit existing page._\n\n**?**\n\n_Use a NOINDEX in `robots.txt` to block that URL._\n\n**You said to look in the search console and look for keywords with high impressions and low clicks. Why?**\n\n_Those pages are probably showing up in search results, but not being clicked on. Those pages represent the best opportunity for optimization._\n\nYou can schedule a call with Dave and read his summary of his talk on his website: [Software Promotions: Microconf 2018 Actionable stuff](https://www.softwarepromotions.com/microconf-2018-resources-dave-collins/).\n",

Redefine Growth\n\nRethink what you think you know about growth; it's not necessarily about getting bigger.\n\n> Growth doesn't just mean getting bigger - that's only a half definition. Growth for you might mean getting smaller: less customers, less employees.\n\nDave's idea of growth is closer to the metal: having better relationships with people.\n\nAs an example, Dave set up a chat app on his website that goes directly to his cellphone. Having more authentic relationships turns customers into his sales team.\n\n![The Parable of the Fisherman @davekiss](https://i.imgur.com/vbHQdGH.jpg)\n\n## 2. Know your reasons\n\nAre you growing your business because you think you have to? You could probably get a bigger ROI from focusing on what you actually want.\n\n\"Growing\" could look like:\n\n* improving your UX\n* clarifying your documentaiton\n* maximizing process efficiency\n* cultivating deeper relationships\n* redesigning your onboarding\n* raising your prices\n\n## 3. Avoid Compulsively Making things Worse\n\nImpulsive growth can:\n\n* Introduce additional risk\n* Slow the decision-making process\n* Bring on extreme technical debt\n* Increase chances of burnout\n\nDo not skip steps. Think this through. Grow within your means.\n\nLook, The internet is the best business platform ever created. Learn in your bedroom on YouTube, reach the other end of the globe\n\nKeep that ambition in check. First decide what you want to be and build that into the core of your company.\n\nThe secret to the best way to scale your company is not a book or an app or a podcast: Being YOU!\n",

He later sold his company and started working for Wildbit - the company behind Beanstalk, Postmark, Deploybot, and Conveyor.\n\nIn this talk, Garrett talks about the lessons he learned running a bootstraped company while going through this major life event.\n\n![Garrett has had a rough 4.79 years. He's lost 120 days - 6.8% - of the last 5 years. That's like sleeping 1.63 hours less every night for five years. #large](https://i.imgur.com/AUsrW8J.png)\n\n# SETTING THE STAGE - be ready for curveballs\n\n![\"Bootstrapped issue tracking application loses customer data, shuts down quickly\" was the headline Garrett expected to see after accidentally deleting 8 hours of customer data. #large](https://i.imgur.com/N6N6zb4.png)\n\n> People often ask about my generally positive attitude and outlook. The thing is, it's actually pretty easy - unfair even - but I literally can't help but start every day on the right foot.\n\nIn the early days of running Sifter, Garrett accidentally deleted 8 hours of customer data. He thought this mistake was serious enough to end his business and make him the laughing stock of the bootstrapper community.\n\nThe actual fallout wasn't nearly as bad as he'd imagined. His customers were beyond understanding, and most of the mistake was recoverable. From this early small mistake, Garrett learned that **responding beats reacting** - when things go wrong, it's important to take the time to focus on what you can affect instead of panicking.\n\n# VALIDATING AN IDEA\n\n<!-- ![Serverless is the new hottness - try codeless by stitching services together!](https://i.imgur.com/xImomZL.png) -->\n\n<!-- > At my first followup, my doctor unwraps my foot and there's some frost bite. Thankfully I was able to keep my cool. -->\n\n<!-- Inspiration doesn't strike. It has to be cultivated. Don't search for ideas. Just start creating and always be on the lookout for ideas. -->\n\n<!-- Payment is your best form of validation, so how do you get there? -->\n\nYou may have an idea, but you don't want to spend a ton of effort figuring out if it's good enough.\n\nYou have to get to point where where people will give you money. The faster, the better.\n\nApproach everything with baby steps. Never go all-in on your first attempt. Build enough to justify payment and learn. Then build the real thing.\n\n> The greater the uncertainty as to whether something will work at all, the less excellence you should invest before you find out. @dhh\n\nJust like how you probably shouldn't take a triple hit of morphine, there's always something bitesized you can do on your business.\n\n![Stripe, MailChimp, WordPress, Zapier, and Airtable make it possible to build the first several version of a web application without code. #large](https://i.imgur.com/tar8kSK.png)\n\n> When you have to prove the value of your ideas by persuading other people to pay for them, it clears out an awful lot of woolly thinking. -Tim O'Reilly\n\n**Sales is research.** Talking to potential customers kills two birds with one stone. Then use that to iterate on your offering.\n\n### Version 1 (of Garrett's Leg)\n\nLet's try the simplest solution.\n\nRecurring revenue from Sifter was an amazing form of disability insurance. It was easy to be scared of health issues, but recurring revenue makes it easier.\n\nPivoting: We learned a little. Some stuff worked. Some didn't. It's time to get serious.\n\nGarrett read [Unthinkable by Scott Rigsby](https://www.amazon.com/Unthinkable-Scott-Rigsby/dp/1414333145) going through negative visualization. This dude won the Hawaiian triathalon. The worst case isn't that bad!\n\nMaintain perspective. Not \"Well. It could be worse.\" But rather \"I can handle this.\"\n\n### Version 2.0 (of Garrett's Leg)\n\nWe feel confident that the best step is to invest in a more ambitious solution.\n\nGarrett committed to what was supposed to be an 8 hour surgery and ~1 week in the hospital. It ended up being two 10 hour surgeries and 3 weeks in the hospital.\n\nHe learned that tiny steps are still steps. The key is that they're your steps. Don't compare your rate of progress to anyone else. (Or to \"past you.\"). The challenges you're facing are uniquely yours. Don't get distracted comparing your journey to anyone else's. Or even past you.\n\nVersion 2.0 of Garrett's leg was a \"free flap\" (a skin graft + a chunk of ham from Garrett's thigh), but it didn't work.\n\n> \"Don't worry, there are plenty of places I can take the flap from.\"\n\nGarrett learned to trust and delegate. Don't give up when your first attempt doesn't go well. In our personal lives, we don't hesitate to trust experts, but with business, too often we try to go it alone.\n\nEven though Garrett's doctor wasn't confidence inspiring, he was the best person for the job. There was no way I was going to give up and try to do it myself. Yet, in business, all too often, that's what we do. Delegation is a learned skill, and it's inherently dependent upon both the delegator and the delegatee.\n\n### Version 2.1 (of Garrett's leg)\n\nAny major effort is going to run into issues and need some follow-on work. Garrett's doctors had already taken one flap from my left leg. They'd need to get another flap. This meant an extended stay in the ICU. 🏥\n\nHe did get a magic morphine button 🔘💊, but his heart rate would go below the alarm level when he tried to sleep. Pain killers. No sleep. Barely eating. A couple of panic attacks. He was in bad shape.\n\n> \"We'll keep you here a few more days and then we'll move you to the floor.\" ...the floor?!?! What the hell kind of hospital is this?!?!\n\nIt was at this point that Garrett reached out to Chris and Natalie (the founders of Wildbit).\n\nProgress isn't automatic. Growing pains are real. At some point, growth will plateau. \"If you build it, they will come.\" Right? Nope. Growing a business takes deliberate and directed action. Even then, it's slow.\n\nGarrett learned that growth is just a formula. You have to look at growth and plateaus as simple formulas. Then set goals accordingly. When your business isn't growing, it's easy to question literally everything. However, you have to remember it's just simple math. And that math can tell you _exactly_ what you need to work on. The good news is that you can see these limits coming a mile away. They should never surprise you.\n\n![When your business isn't growing, it's easy to question literally everything. However, you have to remember it's just simple math. And that math can tell you _exactly_ what you need to work on.](https://i.imgur.com/zltaN4I.png)\n\nGarrett learned to work on the right things. The likelihood of working on the right things correlates closely with what customers are telling you combined with your actual growth numbers. Choosing the right things to work on will always be difficult. However, if you understand this formula and break it down, you have some built-in guidance from the business about where you should focus your efforts.\n\nHow do you grow? One of:\n\n1.  Reduce Churn\n2.  Increase Conversion\n3.  Increase Traffic\n\nPhysical therapy is a great metaphor for business. I've spent an inordinate amount of time in physical therapy, and it's very cyclic. It's about cycles of pain, improvement, plateaus, and making the adjustments to push through the plateaus.\n\nIt's the same thing with our businesses or careers.\n\nWhen you first learn a new skill or set out on a new path, it's really difficult. Then it gets easier. Then you get comfortable.\n\nYou constantly have to push yourself outside of your comfort zone in order to grow.\n\nThis is especially true running a business. With each new achievement, you're going to be playing a new game. You have to adjust.\n\n**Pain and discomfort are part of the process.** Go right up to your limit. Push past it. Suffer a little. Then do it all over again.\n\n### Step back and assess\n\nHow are you doing? Are you meeting your goals? Do you need to try something new?\n\nFor Garrett, it was a major surgery. In business, it may be a major feature release. As things change, it's important to revisit them and take a critical look at where you're at.\n\n![For Garrett, recovery plateaued, and his foot wasn't back in the right position yet.](https://i.imgur.com/6ivx27B.png)\n\nHe learned to focus on tangible goals rather than long-term dreams. Let your dreams light the fire, but remember that incremental and measurable goals are how you really get there.\n\nFor him, the dream was being active again. Playing basketball. Snowboarding. Running. Going hiking or camping with my family. The goals were much smaller: Walk a single mile. Run a single mile. Run a 5k.\n\nIn business, it's the same. Having your business support you full-time is a dream, not a goal. Finding 5 more customers is an actionable goal. Don't worry about two years from now. Focus on here and now, and two years will get here fast.\n\n### Make big decisions\n\nTurning points are never easy, and the answer is rarely obvious.\n\nYou will face turning points where you have to make big decisions. For Garrett, it was an ankle fusion or amputation. Fusion effectively meant no running or jumping ever again.\n\nLesson: protect your focus for the things that really matter, and always work deliberately.\n\nDon't avoid big decisions because they're hard. Put your head down, do the research, decide, and then execute ruthlessly.\n\nElective amputation is about as scary of a decision as you can make. The permanence is really all that makes it scary though.\n\nThe good news with business is that nothing is permanent. You can always go back and fix it.\n\n![Garrett's ankle. Out of position. Arthritic. He talked to 4 surgeons, and they all advised an ankle fusion.](https://i.imgur.com/YDde6OO.jpg)\n\nSo what's the deal with amputation again? Just how active can you be? What are the limitations? Thanks to the books and talking to other amputees, Garrett wasn't scared of amputation.\n\nHe was scared of the permanence and of being wrong, but he was at peace with it pretty quickly.\n\nAll of the amputees he talked to had regret. Specifically, they had one regret…\n\n…the exact same regret.\n\nThey wished they had done it sooner.\n\nAt this point, Garrett and his wife had their second daughter. He was still running Sifter effectively by myself.\n\nThe idea of another major surgery at this point means a lot of burden on Lauren to take care of her family.\n\nFusion would theoretically be a quicker recovery (~3-6 months) with fewer short-term restrictions.\n\nAmputation would mean pushing a lot onto Lauren for the foreseeable future. (~18 months to a full recovery)\n\nThis is a nerve-wracking decision. Amputation felt like it had the best potential for a good long-term outcome.\n\nFusion felt like the safe and responsible thing for Garrett's family as a whole. Yet. With amputation he saw liberation. With a fusion, he only saw shackles.\n\nAnd so they put screws in Garrett's foot. It was the safe play. He originally thought it would be a 6-month detour at worst. They ended up giving it (and other treatments) 18 months.\n\n![Screws in Garrett's foot was the safe play](https://i.imgur.com/ARkrFf5.jpg)\n\nSome time after the fusion, Garrett talked to Wildbit again, but this time, there was a way to move on from Sifter.\n\nThe weight of running a business and feeling an obligation to customers for years of neglect was at odds with the same feelings towards family.\n\nJoining Wildbit was key. He was a terrible boss for himself. Wildbit on the other hand is the healthiest workplace he could imagine. It had been absolutely critical to his recovery.\n\n**For some decisions, there's not an obvious answer.** You may need to make a leap of faith. Do your research, and make a decision. Sitting still can often be worse.\n\n## Is it good enough?\n\nAfter big efforts, launch, and then re-evaluate. Here we are again, only now I had real data on what a fusion was like.\n\nChronic pain. Middling functionality.\n\nBut he could get by, but was \"getting by\" enough?\n\nThe thing about amputation is that it's so permanent. There's no Command-Z. No matter how confident I could have been, it's scary.\n\nHe had to have a framework to weight it all.\n\nGarrett questioned what he was capable of. Are those activities pain-free enough to be enjoyable?\n\nHe tried playing basketball again, but could only tolerate about 30 minutes.\n\nSoon, the pain and disability from ankle fusion was bad enough that Garrett started to see that amputation would be better for his family too. It was clear that if functionality was important to Garrett, the fusion wasn't going to cut it.\n\nAround the same time, after spending 8 years on Sifter and having it financially support him, he sold it. Sifter was in good hands, and he could finally focus more on his recovery or maybe amputation.\n\n**Don't count on data and logic to provide the right answer.** Too often we try to be 100% confident about decisions that require a leap of faith. These days, there's so much talk about A/B testing and data. That stuff's useful, but you can convince yourself of anything.\n\nMoreover, in the early days of a business, you won't have statistical significance.\n\n### Taking the next step\n\nOnce you've handled the basics, the real work begins.\n\n~5 months from deciding to amputate to actually having it. Schedule/rescheduled a couple of times as we tried some other options.\n\nOpportunities to cancel it kept popping up, but I finally said \"enough.\"\n\n![Waking up with just one leg](https://i.imgur.com/dJIxtzp.jpg)\n\n**It's ok to let go.** Just because something is holding you back, doesn't mean you have to hold on too.\n\n### The journey never ends\n\nThere will be milestones, but there's never a finish line.\n\n> \"Daddy, can you run yet? 😊\" => \"You can't beat me! 😛\" => \"Daddy, you're cheating! 😡\"\n\nSix months after amputation, Garrett spent two and a half days snowboarding without pain killers. Today, he can comfortably enjoy a full day on the mountain.\n\n**It's about progress—not aspirations.** Focus on how far you've come because our journeys never end. You'll never reach a finish line.\n\nGarrett isn't where he used to be, and he's not quite where he wants to be, but he's getting there every day.\n\n> Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten. @billgates probably\n\nWhen you're recovering from injuries, you go to physical therapy. When you're recovering, you have a physical therapist. When you're building a business, you find an advisor.\n\n> When you're recovering, you have a physical therapist. When you're building a business, you find an advisor.\n\n**Find your people so they can nudge you along safely.** When you're in the thick of it, it's difficult to know if you're pushing yourself too hard or not hard enough.\n\n![Garrett's ability as an amputee ](https://i.imgur.com/zbHMrGj.png)\n\n![Garrett's mountain biking/snow boarding foot has countless adjustments](https://i.imgur.com/zbHMrGj.png)\n\n**Don't adjust too many variables at once.** With business, you have a ton of dials you can adjust, but only a few matter. Focus on deliberate calibrations rather than random adjustments.\n\n![Garrett can't tease his wife about bringing a suitcase worth of shoes anymore when they travel](https://i.imgur.com/LHRXrUp.jpg)\n\nYou may put on sunglasses or grab an umbrella. Business and life is no different. We can all be confident our circumstances will change. So when it changes, do what humans do. Find a way to adapt.\n\n**We're all adaptive.** Adaptation is unavoidable, and businesses have to adapt and change too.\n\nWhat we're adapting to is different. For some it's losing a leg. For some it's having kids. For others it's a new role at work.\n\nYou're way more adaptive and strong than you realize. You've just never had to unleash that strength. It's there. You just don't know it yet.\n\nWith that, I want to leave you with one thought…\n\n> \"It is not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves.\" -Sir Edmund Hillary, First to summit Mt. Everest\n\nWe all face struggles, but it's never really about the struggles. It's about us.\n\nOr, more specifically, it's about what we're truly capable of.\n\nSo, next time you're facing a mountain, real or figurative, take a step back.\n\nTake a deep breath. Let that mountain light a fire in you.\n\nHave faith in your strength, and go conquer it.\n\n> Next time you're facing a mountain, real or figurative, take a step back. Take a deep breath.

How Jordan Gal turned 5 blog posts and $4k in facebook ads into $348k ARR.\n2. Why Facebook retargeted audiences beat an email list.\n3. How to build an audience from nothing.\n\n<!-- [Download the slides at carthook.com/microconf2018](https://www.carthook.com/microconf2018) -->\n\n# Jordan Gal\n\nJordan Gal is a regular on the Microconf stage. He's the cofounder of [CartHook](https://carthook.com/) - customizable checkout process for ecommerce sites - with [Ben Fisher](http://skinnyandbald.com/) and cohosts the [Bootstrapped Web Podcast](http://bootstrappedweb.com/) with [Brian Casel](https://briancasel.com/).\n\nIn this talk, Gal explains how he ran an effective three month marketing campaign with Facebook ad retargeting.\n\n# Content Marketing + Paid Advertising\n\n![The Advanced Guide to Ecommerce Funnels cover #small](https://i.imgur.com/S4LrsYJ.jpg)\n\nUntil January 2018, Jordan Gal hadn't experimented with content marketing (creating useful free content for your audience that drives attention to a primary product). Unlike traditional paid advertising, which has a direct return on investment (ROI), content marketing is harder to justify because the ROI isn't as clear.\n\nThe CartHook team was working on a new release of their product, so they decided to invest in a big marketing push combining long-term content marketing with the short-term paid advertising they were already familiar with.\n\nTheir content came from hiring a dedicated content writer to write an ebook on the industry trend of marketing funnels in ecommerce stores. While putting it together, each chapter started looking like a blog post, so they decided to get the most value out of what they were working on by publishing and promoting each of the 4 chapters before promoting the book.\n\nHere are the stages of content marketing Gal's CartHook team went through.\n\n<!-- CartHook's general plan was to 1) build an audience, 2) establish credibility by providing value to that audience, and 3) sell that audience. -->\n\n<!-- evergreen content that plants a flag that funnels are a trend -->\n\n<!-- thinking longer term -->\n\n<!-- promote free content to build a retargeted audience in Facebook, then make an offer to that audience. -->\n\n<!-- initial budget: $45/day. -->\n\n<!-- Each email in this sequence was promoted in series -->\n\n<!-- Through the campaign, only a single Facebook audience was used. Each promoted post was advertised to one big bucket of people that had been tracked at some point in the campaign previously. -->\n\n<!-- Additionally, pop up was \"sign up to get the next one in the series\" -->\n\n![Facebook ad](https://i.imgur.com/ohoin9b.jpg)\n\n## 1. Get Attention\n\nIdeally, they would have already had an audience built that they could market this content to, but this was the first time CartHook had invested in any type of content marketing or audience building.\n\nThey started by building an audience to market to. They created a [lookalike audience](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531) from their existing customer email list and added users from active Facebook groups focused on eCommerce. Next, they added the [Facebook Pixel](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/553691765029382) to their website to track new visitors.\n\nThe CartHook team needed a way to start a conversation with these new potential customers. It's straightforward to get attention in the eCommerce world - dollar amounts and screenshots with arrows - so they put together [a post detailing how they'd processed $100-million in 2017](https://blog.carthook.com/100-million-dollars-lighting-way-look-back-2017/) and started promoting it for $45/day.\n\nImportantly, this post wasn't trying to make a sale. The first interaction this new Facebook lookalike audience would have with the CartHook brand would be content.\n\nEach time a Facebook user clicked on their promoted post, they were tracked with CartHook's Facebook Pixel and added to a retargeting audience for the next step.\n\n![Promoted post for \"eCommerce Sales Funnels: A New Trend for Big Growth\"](https://i.imgur.com/wwTOsci.jpg)\n![Promoted post for \"Is Your Shopify Store Ready to Succeed in 2018?\" #small](https://i.imgur.com/bXyBs5U.jpg)\n\n## 2. Establish Credibility\n\nCartHook now had a retargeted audience of people who had expressed interest in the eCommerce space by clicking on their promoted post about the future of eCommerce.\n\nTheir goal with the second stage in their content marketing plan was to promote content to this audience that helps them succeed in larger market trends.\n\nFor CartHook, the eCommerce market trend they'd identified was using sales funnels. They took two chapters from their book on this new market trend and published them online:\n\n- [eCommerce Sales Funnels: A New Trend for Big Growth](https://blog.carthook.com/ecommerce-sales-funnels-a-new-trend-for-big-growth/)\n- [Future Trends: What you Need to Know to Succeed in eCommerce in 2018 and Beyond](https://blog.carthook.com/future-trends-succeed-ecommerce/)\n\nImportantly, these posts aren't trying to sell CartHook's product yet. Their primary goal is to help people in eCommerce succeed by understanding this new sales funnel market trend. By helping people, CartHook is establishing itself as a credible authority with unique and helpful insight. For a guide on how to identify these types of trends in your market, check out [The Greatest Sales Pitch I've Seen All Year](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-best-sales-pitch-ive-seen-all-year-7fa92afaa248).\n\nThese next two posts, like the first, were promoted on Facebook one after another, prioritizing anyone that had visited the CartHook website (retargeted from the Facebook Pixel).\n\n![\"Is Your Checkout Page Optimized to Succeed in 2018?\"](https://i.imgur.com/y6V4R8T.jpg)\n\n![\"Is Mastering Upsells in Your 2018 Plans?\" #small](https://i.imgur.com/0AOwPKj.jpg)\n\n## 3. Product Focus\n\nAt this stage, CartHook had earned the right to talk about their product.\n\nTheir next two promoted posts focused on how their product helps eCommerce stores succeed in the trend of sales funnels:\n\n- [How (and Why) to Optimize your eCommerce Checkout Experience](https://blog.carthook.com/optimize-ecommerce-checkout/)\n- [The Art of Upsells (Boost Your Order Value While Building Trust)](https://blog.carthook.com/art-of-upsells/)\n\nIn particular, they focus on CartHook's differentiating feature: post-purchase upsells.\n\n---\n\n![Facebook promotions and intent popup for The Advanced Guide to Ecommerce Funnels ebook](https://i.imgur.com/8LaET4T.jpg)\n![Webinar promoted post #small](https://i.imgur.com/vXXheKn.jpg)\n\n<!-- ![Webinar email #small](https://i.imgur.com/X4KttlZ.png) -->\n\n## 4. Webinar\n\nEach promoted post page had an intent popup promoting the full ebook, \"The Advanced Guide to eCommerce Funnels.\" Over the course of the campaign, this popup had converted particularly well (4-5%) and collected 1,000 new email addresses. Additionally, CartHook still had a large retargeting list on Facebook.\n\nTo try to convert more of this audience into paid customers, they hosted a webinar showing real results from a high profile \"superfan\" customer that had used CartHook to go from $1M to $2M in revenue in one year.\n\n<!-- By using third party credibility of someone who's succeeding with the product, CartHook could dip into  -->\n\nThis webinar was promoted to both the Facebook retargeted audience and CartHook's new email list.\n\n# Results\n\n![The feeling you get when you spend $4,133.64 and make $212,400 in ARR. \"I was like, we gotta do this all day!\"](https://i.imgur.com/B1j3rDj.jpg)\n\nIn total, Gal and his team spent $4,133.64 on Facebook over this 5-week campaign promoting each post for 7 days.\n\nOver the campaign, they had 127 people sign up for free trials (that's `$4,133.64/127 = $32.55` per signup). Almost all of these signups were from retargeted audiences (i.e.: very few people signed up for a free trial after only seeing one piece of content).\n\nThose 127 signups converted at CartHook's typical 30% trial-to-paid rate, so CartHook got `127 * 0.3 = 38` paying customers for $4,133.64 (that's `$4,133.64 / 38 = $108.78` per paying customer).\n\nThe webinar had 360 registrations with a 19% conversion rate to free trial signups (that's 68 free trials from the webinar). Those 68 signups also converted at 30% to 21 paid accounts.\n\nCartHook is an expensive product - plans start at $300/month - so those 38 customers from the content marketing brought in `38 * $300 = $11,400` in MRR (`$11,400 * 12 = $136,800` in ARR), and the 21 customers from the webinar brought in $6,300 in MRR ($75,600 in ARR).\n\nBetween the original campaign and this webinar, `$136,800 + $75,600 = $212,400` in new ARR was generated. At a gentle 5-10x company evaluation, this single campaign raised the enterprise value of CartHook by **$1-2 million**.\n\n# Questions\n\n**How will you repurpose this content for the next campaign?**\n\n_It caught us off guard how well this worked - we don't have a concrete plan on how to do it again next month. Our primary motivation was to get ourselves out there and establish ourselves as thought leaders in the ecommerce space. Unless we really nail the next idea, it probably won't work as well._\n\n_That said, we only spent $4,000 on advertising this time. We've probably barely scratched the surface of this market. We might be able to just run the same campaign again and exclude people already on the list and get similar results._\n\n**Are the customers you got from this campaign as good as customers you've gotten from other sources?**\n\n_Hopefully!_\n\n**This campaign looks a lot like an email sequence. Could you have done this entirely in email?**\n\n_Getting people's attention in email is harder. 95% of traffic to CartHook didn't opt into our email list, and without Facebook retargeting we couldn't have contacted them again._\n\n_Retargeting removes email opt-ins as a goal. If you visit our site, we're going to market to you one way or another._\n\n**Did you advertise anywhere else?**\n\n_Yes - we also tried retargeting with Google. It didn't work as well._\n\n**Why did you promote the pieces serially instead of in parallel?**\n\nWe're just going to tell a story for six weeks in sequence and hope that people capture the content in that order. There are links in each blog post to the previous post so they could catch up if they jumped in in the middle.\n\n<!-- _To capture and build up maximum attention, though we might not do it like this in the future._ -->\n\n**It seems like Facebook and Google are working better for you than Email. What other platforms are you excited about?**\n\n_Partner webinars. Reaching into another person's audience with credibility is the idea. That credibility helps when selling a $300/month app._\n\n<iframe sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://lan.io/blog/podcast/jordan-gal/embed/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"700\" title=\"Rob Walling Recap Interview - Lanio\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\"></iframe>\n<script type='text/javascript'>const wp = document.querySelector(\".wp-embedded-content\"); window.addEventListener(\"message\", ({data, origin}) => {if(origin === \"https://lan.io\" && data && data.message === \"height\" && data.value) wp.height = data.value})</script>\n",

The shop, realdeal, turned out to be a huge mistake.\n\n<!-- ![15 year old Justin Jackson's dream was to start his own snowboard shop #large](https://i.imgur.com/bExR2as.jpg) -->\n\nWhy? Starting a retail shop is incredibly expensive: unused inventory, suppliers, employee salaries, and lease costs add up quickly.\n\nTwo years later, at 25 years old, he closed the shop $85,000 in debt.\n\nHe learned several important lessons from this painful experience:\n\n**1. Choosing the right customer is more important than what you sell.**\n\n![A typical snowboard shop customer named \"Fauckler.\" Does it look like he has any money? Snowboarders are bad customers. #small](https://i.imgur.com/fkiOrGk.jpg)\n\nSnowboarders may be fun to hang out with, but they make shitty customers. Don't make a product for people who don't have enough money to pay you for it.\n\n**2. Starting small is almost always better than going big.**\n\n<!-- ![The lessons you learn when you start small just get magnified when you go big.](https://i.imgur.com/HXu1ViU.jpg) -->\n\nIt's tempting to aim big for your business right away, but it's much easier to learn when your business is smaller. If Justin had started realdeal from a van, he could've learned what it's like keeping inventory, and that he doesn't like serving snowboarders as customers. Starting small from a van would've been a much less expensive way for Justin to realize he didn't like the snowboard shop business.\n\nFor more on the idea of starting small, read Derek Sivers on [Version Infinity](https://sivers.org/infinity) and watch his YouTube video [Start Now. No funding needed](https://youtu.be/7KLnXjqKL5g).\n\n**3. The way we start businesses is wrong.**\n\nThe conventional wisdom behind building businesses is that you:\n\n1.  Get a good idea\n2.  Validate your idea to prove product/market fit\n3.  Build and launch your idea\n4.  Start making money\n\nHere's Justin Jackson's unconventional product validation idea: **it's not enough to just get product/market fit**.\n\nIn addition to product/market fit (does your product satisfy the need of a healthy market?), you should also be validating:\n\n- **market/founder fit**: Are your customers easy to reach? Do you like them? Do you want to help them every day for the rest of your life?\n- **product/founder fit**: Is this product a good fit for what you want? Does it match with your values? Does it get you where you want to go?\n\n# Product Validation Roadmap 🗺\n\nHere's Justin's step-by-step approach for:\n\n- Identifying who you are, and what you want\n- Choosing a market\n- Discovering what your market wants\n- Shipping a (small) initial solution\n\nThis approach can help no matter where you are in the product cycle, from ideation to growing a profitable business.\n\n## Section 1: Know thyself\n\nThere's no sense going through the work of building something if you don't know what you're aiming for.\n\n<!-- People call Justin for coaching all the time trying to get him to validate their idea. \"I wanna do arbitrage for cryptocurrency...\" - Justin isn't the target market! He can't validate your idea for you. But he knows you need to figure out _why_ you want to do this. -->\n\nDefine your desires precisely and you'll:\n\n- be much more likely to achieve them\n- be able to much more easily rule out ideas that don't further your goals\n\n### Question 1: What's your motivation for wanting to build a product?\n\nTry finishing this sentence: _\"I want to build a product so that I can...\"_\n\nDo you want to be able to quit your job? Spend more time with your kids? Have more wealth? Snowboard more? Write it down!\n\n### Question 2: What do you value?\n\nWhat are your guiding principles you pursue above all other goals?\n\nCheck out James Clear's [large list of core values](https://jamesclear.com/core-values) for inspiration.\n\n### Question 3: How rich do you want to be?\n\nPrecisely how much money would you like to have?\n\n- Basic needs ($50k-$100k / year)\n- Financially secure ($150k / year)\n- Higher than average ($300k / year)\n- Very wealthy ($1 million+)\n\n## Section 2: Choose your market\n\n![Ian Landsman's first customers for HelpSpot were the people at the college he was working at. #small](https://i.imgur.com/PviYueE.jpg)\n\n![Björn Forsberg's audience is people with shopify apps - a 500,000 person market that already spend $29-299/month on their shopify account. That's a great market: it's big, and they spend money. #small](https://i.imgur.com/Ei6ScDD.jpg)\n\n<!-- ![Adam Wathan's audience (PHP developers) is super easy to reach - they all hang out on twitter @adamwathan #small](https://i.imgur.com/TSSKrjn.jpg) -->\n\nWho do you want to help? A great business isn't about you and your dream. It's about helping your customers achieve their dreams.\n\nTo choose your market, ask who you want to help. When deciding, consider:\n\n1.  How do they spend money?\n2.  How big is the market?\n3.  How easy are they to reach? Adam Wathan's audience (PHP developers) is super easy to reach - they all hang out on twitter.\n\n> A great business isn't about you and your dream. It's about helping your customers achieve their dreams.\n\nA few ideas for finding your market:\n\n- How do you currently make a living?\n- What kind of customers do you serve at work? These are people already paying for your expertise.\n- What communities do you belong to?\n- What do you do better than anyone else?\n\n## Section 3: Customer research\n\nWhat are the big pain points in your market that already exist? What problems are simmering in your target market?\n\n[Björn Forsberg](https://www.forsbergplustwo.com/) was doing customer research in [the Shopify discussion forums](https://ecommerce.shopify.com/forums) day after day and noticed that people regularly complained about how difficult it was to print shipping labels, so he made an app to make that easier.\n\n![ProductValidator.com helps you see your audience's pain points](https://i.imgur.com/jqIqCDr.png)\n\nFinding out what questions your audience is trying to answer is a great way to notice what pain they're experiencing. What does your audience search on Google? What kinds of questions are they asking consistently? Try researching on:\n\n- [Product Validator](https://productvalidator.com)\n- [Answer the public](https://answerthepublic.com)\n- [ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com)\n\nCustomer interviews via. phone, skype, or in-person are hard, but are incomparably information-dense and surprisingly easy to get. Try asking:\n\n1.  What's your focus right now at work? What are you looking to improve?\n2.  What's something you'd like to accomplish, but can't? What's holding you back?\n3.  What was the last product, service, or tool you bought for work? (if they can't think of something, they might be in a bad market)\n4.  What's your least favorite tool you have to use right now?\n5.  What kinds of tasks are you currently doing in Excel?\n6.  What product do you wish existed (but doesn't yet)?\n7.  What trends are you seeing in the community? (ex: GDPR is hot in the Microconf community)\n\n![GDPR hate is trendy in Microconf](https://i.imgur.com/b55BAEG.png)\n\nSummarize your research\n\n- What patterns emerged?\n- What would say are the #1 and #2 things your market is struggling with?\n- What would it mean for them if you solved that struggle?\n\nRemember that you're not just putting apps into the world, you're helping actual people in a meaningful way.\n\n## Section 4: Your hypothesis\n\nTake your research about your audience and their pain to daydream potential solutions by filling out this simple template:\n\n_`${market}` wants `${outcome}`, but struggle with `${struggle}`. I can help them by removing these obstacles. Now, their life looks like this: `${better_life}`._\n\nHere's an example for an audience Justin Jackson is personally targeting:\n\n_Many `tech businesses` want `a branded podcast`, but struggle with `getting listeners`._\n_I can help them by:_\n\n- _improving their show art + description_\n- _getting them more ratings + reviews_\n- _making their episodes easier to share_\n\n_Now, their podcast `has more downloads, and their business has more brand awareness`._\n\n## Section 5: Start helping now\n\nWhat's the smallest possible thing you could do that would validate your hypothesis?\n\nFor Justin Jackson's tech business audience, potential small projects that could validate his hypothesis include:\n\n> \"If you want to be useful, you can always start now, with only 1% of what you have in your grand vision. It’ll be a humble prototype version of your grand vision, but you’ll be in the game...Starting small puts 100% of your energy on actually solving real problems for real people.\" @sivers\n\n- A podcast consulting service for getting more listeners?\n- Video tutorials on podcasting?\n- A WordPress plugin that makes it easier to publish podcasts?\n- A simple podcasting utility?\n\n## Section 6: Evaluate results\n\nWhat does initial validation look like? How do you know if you're successful? Good indicators are getting email addresses or preorders, and the best form of validation is getting real money from your audience.\n\n![Before Jason Cohen built WPEngine, he pitched it to people in person and asked if they would pay for it, then asked if they'd write him a check for their first month. #small](https://i.imgur.com/nu4V0G2.jpg)\n\n> When you ask your audience “would you buy this”, many may say they will, but when it comes time to pay they don’t. Building a list is important, but it’s not a true indication of whether or not a product will sell. True validation comes from people actually paying you for that idea. @PatFlynn\n\nNoticing trends in the industry that match your hypothesis will also help you know you're on the right track:\n\n- What is your target market investing in? (ex: ReWork podcast is a $200k/year investment from basecamp, which is a sign that Justin's hypothesis that tech businesses want a branded podcast is more likely)\n- What's getting a lot of publicity right now?\n- What are people struggling with?\n\n# Summary of the Product Building Process\n\nStart with a small free offering. If that works, move to a small paid offering. If that works. build a simple product. If that works, put more features in and charge more.\n\n![Rob Walling's Star Step Approach to building a business. #large](https://i.imgur.com/ZWqFAJC.png)\n\n## Transistor.fm case study\n\nHere's how this process has worked so far for Transistor.fm.\n\nJustin started with some small free offerings of podcasts:\n\n- [ProductPeople.tv](http://ProductPeople.tv)\n- [MegaMaker](https://megamaker.co/)\n- [Build Your SaaS](https://saas.transistor.fm)\n\nIn the process, he noticed some trends. 75% of people who bought Marketing for Devs were podcast listeners and made a huge effort to come talk to him because they felt like they'd known him for years ([\"If you make it to Vernon, BC, I'll buy you coffee\"](https://justinjackson.ca/coffee/)).\n\n![Transistor.fm stair stepper case study](https://i.imgur.com/6IWKaUe.png)\n\nJustin also noticed a trend of tech businesses launching podcasts: [StartUp by Gimlet](https://www.gimletmedia.com/startup/), [CodePen Radio](https://blog.codepen.io/radio/), and others.\n\n> \"64.35% of my customers came from hearing me on a\n> podcast.\" -Brian Casel\n\nJohn works for Cards Against Humanity, so Cards Against Humanity was Transistor.fm's first client in starting [The Good News Podcast](http://www.thegoodnewspodcast.fm/).\n\nGoogle is now transcribing and scraping Audio content - that's a huge positive sign in the trend of podcasting.\n\n# Questions\n\n**Who's your favorite American podcaster?**\n\n_[Adam Clark](http://avclark.com/), for sure._\n\n**If you're already two months in with 6-10 customers, is it worth going back and going through this process?**\n\n_I think it is - there's so much pain if you don't figure out the personal questions of what you want, value, and how much money you want to make. If it keeps growing and doesn't match your values you'll end up in a lot of pain._\n\n_Don't get stuck doing something you hate. I had an opportunity to help found a company that regulates gambling machines in India, but even though the money would've been fantastic it wouldn't have aligned with my values._\n\n**Is B2C SaaS always a bad idea?**\n\n_Ugh. Yes, but there are definitely people that make it work._\n\n_SaaS B2C businesses are things people desire: Netflix, Spotify, Apple Music, etc. It's hard to deliver that if you're a bootstrapper._\n\n_Prosumers are different - that sometimes works._\n\n**Do you consider parameters for failures when forming your hypothesis?**\n\n_I've launched so many times that I have much better parameters for success now. If I can't get 500 people on a mailing list, I have a sense the idea probably isn't going to work._\n\n_I know the market needs to be big enough to make enough money for me to support my family._\n\nDownload Justin Jackson's slides for this talk at [megamaker.co/microconf2018](https://megamaker.co/microconf2018), and more from him on this topic at [productvalidationchecklist.com](https://productvalidationchecklist.com).\n\n<iframe sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://lan.io/blog/podcast/justin-jackson/embed/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"700\" title=\"Rob Walling Recap Interview - Lanio\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\"></iframe>\n<script type='text/javascript'>const wp = document.querySelector(\".wp-embedded-content\"); window.addEventListener(\"message\", ({data, origin}) => {if(origin === \"https://lan.io\" && data && data.message === \"height\" && data.value) wp.height = data.value})</script>\n",

Currently director of [Fomo](https://usefomo.com).\n\n## [Fomo](https://usefomo.com)\n\nSocial proof app that boosts conversion rates (ex: \"your friend just bought this thing!\"). Used to be a shopify app (\"notify\") doing 18k MRR, then Justin and his brother bought it with seller financing (ask him about this!).\n\nJustin saw a massive conversion boost (20%) by implementing Fomo on his other site, [Kettle and Fire](https://www.kettleandfire.com/).\n\n## First 18 months to 4x\n\nHere's what Justin did to grow Fomo 4x in 18 months.\n\n### Day 1: Raise Prices\n\nSo many people still don't do this. They feel like they want to give their customers a good deal, and raising prices cheats their customers.\n\nJustin raised the bottom tier from $14.99/month to $29/month, and added multiple tiers up to $199/month. Now he could capture the value of higher value customers.\n\nAfter raising prices, they saw basically no difference in conversions. Raising the prices just got rid of \"kicking the tires\" bad customers.\n\n### Day 2: Optimize the shopify listing\n\n> What can we do to increase the likelihood that someone signs up?\n\nShamelessly ask for reviews! \"If you like notify, could you take 30 seconds to help me grow my little business? If you have any feature ideas, let me know! We're adding features over the next few months\"\n\nThis catapulted Fomo to the top of Shopify ratings with 50 new reviews. Shopify is also excited about sharing Fomo. Also [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/).\n\n### Day 3: Churn\n\nStarted with churn of 1-19%. If their app got delisted, they'd be out of business in 5 months!\n\nHow'd they decrease churn? Lots of no-brainers: show your customers that by using your product, they make more money. Fomo did it with [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com) automatic emails.\n\nThey also initiated as many one-on-one emails as they could. Five days after signing up, customers get an email `Intro: ${customer_name} <> ${customer_support}` from the CEO.\n\nAlso, hire! Hire enough people to decrease customer support response time. They also get a much better pulse of what customers want.\n\nAt day 90, churn was down from 19% to under 8%.\n\n### Integrations\n\nFomo invested in building integrations, like a line of Javascript to integrate with with BigCommerce (which cost $1,500). In the first 45 days this integration was live, it made $1,000 (now at ~$8k/month).\n\nAfter doing more integrations, Shopify went from 100% of business to under 40%.\n\nToday Fomo has over 50 integrations.\n\n![FOMO has over 50 integrations](https://i.imgur.com/CrhrxCk.png)\n\nFomo now buys smaller businesses (like [Built with Shopify](https://www.builtwithshopify.com/), ~30k uniques/month), which is like cheating at integrations.\n\n### Results\n\n4x the business! From ~$25k MRR to $100k MRR this month.\n\n---\n\n## Q/A\n\n**How did you decide to hire 3 full time service reps? Did you look at alternatives?**\n\nWe didn't do it from day 1. Our first hire was a customer support person, and they had a positive ROI by preventing churning and upselling. They paid for themself 100x over.\n\n**Did you hire any software developers?**\n\nJustin's cofounder did most of the development, then hired out development to a dev shop investing the founders' money.\n\n**How did you approach the competitors that you acquired?**\n\nOn day 1, we emailed all 20 of our competitors and asked if they were open at all. More than half said they were interested in selling, integrating, and walking away.\n\n**Re: raise prices, how did you come to that magic number? How did you know you weren't pricing too high?**\n\nI still don't know we're at the magic number! We tested it and it worked well. We split tested sending special offers to existing customers (`upgrade now for ${price}!`).\n\n**Did you grandfather existing customers?**\n\nYes, for a year.\n\n**Do you have negotiation tips for negotiation integrations?**\n\nHave something in it for your integration partner! Promote them.\n\n**How are you differentiating yourself from your competitors?**\n\nOne of our biggest competitors just went through YCombinator. There's not a ton we can do with feature differentiation - it's a rat race. What we focus on is the actual experience of using the product. If you have two matching products, integrations and customer support and scaling and the overall smoothness of the experience is what makes the difference.\n\n> If you have two matching products, you'll choose the one with a better overall experience.\n\nThe overall market is bigger with competitors, which actually works to our advantage.\n\n**How did you connect with Zapier?**\n\nWe cold emailed their partner integration partner person. It was pretty easy for us.\n\n**Other than Zapier, do you have an API?**\n\n[Yes](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/fomo) - it's been a big win for our larger customers.\n\n**How do you source and onboard a support team?**\n\nWe hire support from development bootcamps. Dev bootcamps don't make you a strong, facebook-level engineer, so they're having trouble finding work. We put them through the customer support training we care about and another $25k/month technical course\n\n\"You're not good enough to code for real yet, so come here and do customer support and we'll invest in you. After a year you can either get onboarded as an engineer or move on.\"\n",

You could be connecting more genuinely with your users.\n\n![Comedy Reading List](https://i.imgur.com/5N8VOFt.jpg)\n\n![If your SaaS isn't using humor, you aren't getting the results you deserve. You could be connecting more genuinely with your users.](https://i.imgur.com/RUTKl38.png)\n\nFunny copy can be _longer_ and _convert better_. There's a strong connection between humor and money.\n\n> There's a strong connection between humor and money.\n\n_\"Ok yeah but my software isn't funny\"_ - is it less funny than [stormwater compliance software](https://www.mapistry.com/)?\n\n## 1. WHY humor affects us\n\nWhy is humor sometimes uncomfortable? It **makes us vulnerable**. Past experiences of offending people make us wary, and we feel like work should be serious.\n\nHumor has huge advantages though. It activates parts of the brain associated with happiness and fulfillment that make us more receptive.\n\n![Don't make your user feel like your product is a taskmaster - nobody wants to do work](https://i.imgur.com/XSirBZe.png)\n\nEven when your campaign is delivering bad news (like prices )\n\n### Humor topics\n\n_What is a joke I don't understand teach me_ - you probably if you're German\n\nPick your humor topic by asking your users what they like (movies, books, standup comedians, dank memes, etc.)\n\n![How do you know what your users will find funny? Literally ask them.](https://i.imgur.com/IaSyp1c.jpg)\n\nOnce you know what your users think is funny, humor topics are anything both you and your users think are funny.\n\n![Humor topics are anything both you and your users think are funny](https://i.imgur.com/ku6gVNA.png)\n\n### Humor Style\n\nGenerally, humor can be either **observational** or **self-deprecating**.\n\n![Observational humor in SaaS](https://i.imgur.com/uIC8w5q.png)\n\nSelf-deprecating humor is making fun of yourself or your product. You're the butt of the joke, so the risk of offending is low.\n\n![Self-deprecating humor in SaaS](https://i.imgur.com/3kIKHFH.png)\n\n## 2. WHERE to use humor to best effect\n\nDon't use humor in your value proposition (the quick line or two of text explaining what it is you do and why your users should care). This could muddy your value proposition and lose your customer quickly.\n\nIf you're sending traffic to landing pages, it's okay to crack a joke because you know more about your users. Surprising humor can keep your user reading.\n\nHumor also works very well in emails and in your app experience (ex: instead of just \"date range\", \"date range be like\" from FOMO has more personality).\n\n## 3. HOW to punch up your copy line by line\n\nThere are three types of comedy punchups:\n\n1.  Show your emotions\n2.  Piss off your grammar teacher\n3.  Lead the way\n\n### 1. Show your emotions\n\nWriting in ALL CAPS (sparingly, so you don't seem like an old person trying to use the internet) is a great way to show emotion in copy.\n\n![Rockin' Green showin' emotion](https://i.imgur.com/uP2QtVB.png)\n\nComic book words - tangible action words - breath emotion into your copy\n\n![ZAPPIN some action words your way](https://i.imgur.com/AJHG2EP.jpg)\n\n![Comic book words in SaaS copy shows emotion](https://i.imgur.com/CzqSj4v.png)\n\nMaking asides is another great way to humanize your copy.\n\n![Making asides in SaaS copy shows emotion](https://i.imgur.com/u22ZFOc.png)\n\nGifs can be great, but use them sparingly. If they're too long, referencing jokes your users won't get, or irrelevent to their context they won't work well.\n\n### 2. Piss Off Your Grammar Teacher (POYGT)\n\nUsing unconventional grammar can increase conversions:\n\n* adsf\n* Including a typo in your subject line (like \"moar\")\n* using contractions and abbreviations (now \"Hot is it going (fellow kids)\", but \"so I wanna know\", \"gonna\", etc.)\n* chop up your sentences\n\n![Humanizing friendly abbreviations to use in copy](https://i.imgur.com/kitKfXY.png)\n\n![Chop up your sentences](https://i.imgur.com/vKXKLMM.png)\n\n### 3. Lead the Way\n\nAsk and answer questions to get right to what your user is thinking.\n\n![Lead the way by anticipating your user's questions](https://i.imgur.com/nqa34fk.jpg)\n\nYou can also try trailing off with ellipsis...\n\n...and including a call to action! \"Upgrade my Bear!\" is a great CTA, \"take a look inside\" isn't.\n\n## Recap\n\n![Key ways of being funny by Lianna Patch](https://i.imgur.com/Z3zygLn.png)\n\n---\n\n# Questions\n\n**Hi, I'm in the funeral niche...**\n\n![\"Hi, I'm in the funeral niche...\"](https://i.imgur.com/OXuMFuJ.gif)\n\n**...does it really work across all industries?**\n\nResults may vary. It's totally possible though. You know your target client: if they're cool with death, it could totally work.\n\n**Do you know a type of humor that can work across age demographics?**\n\nStart with research into what your audience thinks is funny! Now that you know misspellings don't work on older people but do on younger people, you can tailor your humor accordingly.\n\n**Does B2B vs. B2C matter?**\n\nB2C has gone whole-hog with humor. Would you rather have a president that can crack a joke about himself, or one that can't take a joke?\n\n**How do you ask people what they think is funny?**\n\nIt's random and surprises people. Sandwich it between other user research. Ask two questions with data you really need to know, then reward them with a question about what they think is funny.\n\n**We used to have a gif of Arnold lifting weights but it was cats instead of weights, and most people found it funny but some called us animal abusers. What do you do with those kind of reactions?**\n\n![Apparently some people find this offensive](https://i.imgur.com/jxaAK9m.gif)\n\nAsk who your ideal user is - what's the lifetime value of someone who likes the gif vs. those who don't? Focus on people who are worth it to you.\n\n**How do we test what's offensive? Are there baby steps if you're in a sensitive, serious industry like public safety?**\n\nIntegrate humor slowly and cautiously. Test a version of _a_ joke in _one_ email.\n",

She's made a lot of mistakes in her business that could've been avoided if she'd followed the advice of MicroConf.\n\nThis talk is a very honest behind-the-scenes look at what's happened since her company - [Oki Doki](https://oki.doki.io/) - launched, and their journey to sustainability.\n\nMarie and Ben couldn't afford the expensive real estate in Vancouver while bootstrapping, so they bought a half-acre property on the Sunshine Coast of Canada.\n\n![Marie, Ben, and Mochi's property on the Sunshine Coast of Canada.](https://i.imgur.com/IKm1wvA.jpg)\n\nThey had no idea how to maintain the land or gardens. On the suggestion of a friend, Marie decided to take a class in permaculture. The class promised to \"become a more conscious designer of your life, landscape, relationships, and work while learning how to save time, energy, and money.\" That sounded compelling!\n\n# Permaculture\n\n![Permaculture principles, with highlighted principles relevant to SaaS. #large](https://i.imgur.com/WDG7u8H.png)\n\nAccording to Toby Hemenway - a leading permaculturist - permaculture is \"a set of techniques and principles for designing sustainable human settlements.\" It's a practice for clarifying what you want and how to sustainably get it.\n\nIn studying Permaculture, Marie noticed many parallels to what she wanted out of her SaaS business. She wondered what her business would look like if she approached it with the same intentionality as she was thinking about her land.\n\n# Oki Doki\n\nBen and Marie teamed up in early 2014 to form Oki Doki. Marie handled web design and strategy while Ben handled development projects. Though they'd teamed up, they kept their processes and clients separate.\n\nMarie's clients were well paying people who had online courses, membership programs, and productized services. It took a lot of manual work for her to set up her clients' custom integrations in a hodge podge of WordPress plugins.\n\nBen had the idea to build their own course platform to automate Marie's tedious client setup process. They started building Doki later that year, though they didn't do any customer research or audience building.\n\nIn parallel, Marie was developing a program to help web designers transition into the role of digital strategist called Digital Strategy School. She raised $10k pre-selling an alpha version of the course, and $50k pre-selling the beta to a list of only 300 people.\n\nNow that they had some money banked up, Ben decided to go full time building Doki.\n\n## Permaculture Lesson 1: Observe & Interact\n\n![Marie and Ben learned that any plants left uncovered were an all-you-can-eat buffet for deer.](https://i.imgur.com/NwgkEny.jpg)\n\nIn permaculture, you study everything you can about the land before making major decisions. What are the temperature ranges? Where does the sun and shade land? Are there predators? What plants are fertile? Before you've observed the environment, it's easy to make avoidable mistakes like planting uncovered alpine strawberries that get feasted on by local deer.\n\nThey'd made a similar mistake building Doki. They didn't do any deep-digging customer interviews to help understand their customer landscape before going all-in. They didn't consider what their lives would look like if the business succeeded.\n\nThe permaculture lesson Marie learned was to make sure she truly, deeply understood the landscape before starting to build. That means 20-100 deep customer interviews to understand why things happen the way they do before touching a line of code.\n\n## Permaculture Lesson 2: Use Small and Slow Solutions\n\n![A perfect tropical oasis isn't where to start, it's where you incrementally build to.](https://i.imgur.com/KNwyUnB.jpg)\n\nIn permaculture, it's infeasible to start by building a perfect tropical oasis in your backyard. A better step would be a simple raised garden bed.\n\nWhen building software, instead of spending months building perfect scale-ready over-engineered infrastructure, start with the smallest useful thing you can sell to a customer. What's the \"single raised garden bed\" version of your application?\n\nMarie and Ben made the mistake of building too much too fast for Doki. The first version of their software was built in secret with extravagant features (like complex multi-user permissions). Their first product demo happened after the product was already built.\n\nA better first version of Doki could've looked like a single landing page with signup blog posts, a few prototypes, and office hour consultations. By watching people use the small pieces they built, it would've been much clearer which parts of Doki were intuitive and which weren't. By having more conversations with their audience of course creators, they would've better understood their challenges. By sharing early concepts of Doki, they would've let their customers lead their innovation.\n\nInstead, they spent so much time building Doki in secret that they were afraid to tell people about it, because that would mean they could fail.\n\nEven with these mistakes, they managed to get to $1k MRR from their immediate network at the beginning of 2016.\n\n## Permaculture Lesson 3: Design from patterns to details\n\nIn permaculture, following high level patterns of working with nature are more important than most detailed decisions. Instead of worrying about what color to paint your house facing the road, face your house to the sun. Instead of deliberating what type of grass to plant in your lawn, plant a garden.\n\nIn software, it's easy to get caught up in the details of what technical stack to use or what specific features to implement. Instead, focus on the bigger picture. What do your users actually care about?\n\nOnce Marie and Ben started having conversations with users, they realized the reason they were interested in a course platform was to diversify their consulting offerings. Users were interested in solving the problem of how to turn their one-on-one consulting into a course. Instead of caring about specific software features, Doki's users wanted help building courses.\n\nTo help broaden her focus and make sure she wasn't getting caught in the details, Marie found it useful to ask \"how might we...?\" questions. For example, \"how might we improve the experience of teaching?\" High-level pattern questions like this lead to better solutions than trying to optimize your course platform software's refresh time.\n\n## Permaculture lesson 4: Integrate, rather than segregate\n\n![Chickens integrated with plants creates an environment of healthier chickens and plants.](https://i.imgur.com/xWk5X7M.jpg)\n\nIn permaculture, complementary systems are brought together to make a healthier ecosystem.\n\nMarie was running Digital Strategy School and Ben was building Doki completely separately, but Ben couldn't build and market Doki alone. Marie wondered how they could better integrate their efforts.\n\n![Marie and Ben launched a product - Run Your Learning Launch - to help people learn how to launch their first course, which integrated perfectly with Doki and private consulting.](https://i.imgur.com/uAGo3ik.jpg)\n\nMarie put Digital Strategy School on hold and doubled down on building a course to help people launch their first course - Run Your Learning Launch. She also returned to course consulting services. Marie and Ben found it was easier to sell $2k/mo consulting retainers than a $49/mo SaaS subscription.\n\nIn working more with clients 1:1, she noticed they were:\n\n- spending too long building their courses before validating their ideas with their learners\n- fire-hosing their learners with too much information up front\n- expecting their first courses to replace their client income\n\nThese lessons could be used to improve her Run Your Learning Launch course and the Doki software platform.\n\nMarie and Ben now had an integrated product/SaaS/service ecosystem. Marie's Run Your Learning Launch course helped people learn how to create a course, which could lead people to using the Doki SaaS platform to host their course and book course consulting\n\n## 5. Creatively use and respond to change\n\n![Marie and Ben adapted their language and features to serve their best customers.](https://i.imgur.com/xNsrrqZ.png)\n\nIn permaculture, problems are looked at as potential solutions. Instead of having too many aphids, perhaps you have an ecosystem that could support more ladybugs.\n\nMarie and Ben had to adapt their business in a way that made sense for the way they worked with people. After two years of working with course creators and coaches, they had a much better understanding of who their best customers were and what their problems were.\n\nWith this improved understanding, they could stop worrying about what their competitors were doing and focus on what their customers needed. This focused their copy and features.\n\n# Takeaway\n\n![Marie, Ben, and Mochi living a great life with their small business.](https://i.imgur.com/g1e2EDU.jpg)\n\nIt took OKI DOKI 3 years to find their groove and become sustainable, and they feel great about that pace. They've made a conscious choice to grow slowly with less stress and less FOMO.\n\nWhat do you want to get out of your SaaS, and how hard are you willing to work for it? Why hustle harder for a life you already have? You can make a great living as a small company and love life.\n\n# Questions\n\n**How do you set ground rules being married to your business partner? Have you set up \"just in case\" scenarios?**\n\n_We treat each other like equals and give each other a ton of autonomy. We found out we have to have a meeting every week to get on the same page. Weekly meetings and check-ins, being honest about strengths and limitations, and getting an outside perspective._\n\n**What other ways can you know if you're creating resonance?**\n\n_Get your friends and other people in the industry to describe what you do to someone else. How do outside people perceive you? What words do they use? Those are the words that are going to create resonance with new customers._\n\n**How did competition in the online learning landscape factor in your business decisions?**\n\n_Our mastermind group suggested using high-touch onboarding as our strategic advantage. I love talking to people - that's our strength, let's use it to our advantage._\n\n**Could you talk more about your nontechnical diverse audience?**\n\n_Don't get stuck in your bubble of technical entrepreneurs - there are so many other kinds of people out there. Women especially are very willing to pay for help._\n\nFor more on Oki Doki, check out the [Oki Doki Launch Page](http://learn.weareokidoki.com/launch/).

How to keep new hires confident they're doing a great job\n\n# Matt Molter\n\nMatt Molter was a police officer for 11 years, then started [Agency360](https://agency360.com/) - a SaaS tool for tracking new hires for police departments and 911 centers.\n\n3 ago, Molter realized he needed help, so he started hiring. He'd heard the classic advice (\"A people hire other A people\") and listened to [Rob and Mike's hiring advice on their podcast](https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/?s=hiring&x=0&y=0), yet still made several hiring mistakes hiring his first five employees.\n\nIn this talk, Molter offers his tips for not falling for the same hiring mistakes he did so you can avoid the stress and pain of a bad hire.\n\nYou can reach Matt at matt@agency360.com\n\n# 1. Know What You Are Looking For\n\nBefore you hire someone, define precisely what you want from them.\n\nMake sure you've answered:\n\n1.  What you need (ex: \"someone who cares about sales more than I do\")\n1.  What culture you're creating\n1.  What your new hire will do (ex: \"60% of your time will be on inbound leads and emails, 30% on outbound things, and 10% random stuff because we're a small company\")\n1.  Why your new hire should work for you\n\n![What does a good job look like? Job applicants love specific job descriptions. #large](https://i.imgur.com/6xX27LG.png)\n\n# 2. Don't Be Desperate\n\nDon't just hire the first available person - take as much time as you need to find the right person. A bad hire can cost you months or years.\n\nMake sure you're thinking about:\n\n1.  What location do they reside? (ex: Sales Managers can be found on linkedin)\n1.  Who might know these people? (ex: ask friends and family if they know someone)\n1.  Where do/have they worked?\n1.  Why should they switch?\n\nAn outbound cold email for a potential candidate might look like this:\n\n*Hi (Name),*\n\n*I am the founder of a growing software company out of Launch Fishers. As we continue to expand we are looking for a sales manager. Looking at your background we might be a good fit for each other. Do you have a few minutes to grab coffee and discuss?*\n\n*-Matt*\n\n# 3. Ensure They Have the Right Skills\n\n\nDon't just rely on a reference to know if a candidate is right for your job. Potential hires aren't necessarily qualified because they worked for a big company. Bring them in for a longer interview and directly test:\n\n1.  Have they done this before?\n1.  What is their thought process?\n1.  Are they driven to improve?\n1.  Do they work well with the team?\n\nThe cream of the crop rises quickly with open-ended real-world-mocked tests.\n\nAfter the test, ask your candidate how they think they did. You'll learn a lot about how they work.\n\n![A real-world exercise Matt uses to test Sales Manager candidate skills. #large](https://i.imgur.com/BGoMgWz.png)\n",

    "body": "\nMatthew will send you [a free copy of his ebook](https://tiny.cc/microconf)\n\nWhat is an informational interview? The stated goal is just learning, but it's actually about learning, user feedback, sales, and connections.\n\nThis method isn't conclusive - it's only been used by 9 people with a 15-40% success rate. It's worth taking a look.\n\n## 1. Similarities\n\nPoint out similarities between you and your cold email target. Not \"We’re both entrepreneurs.\", but \"We both worked in product management before starting self-funded companies.\"\n\n## 2. Right person\n\n\"You’ve sold to IT managers in your last few jobs, and I’m trying to learn what they care about most.\", not \"I'd like to learn more about sales.\"\n\n## 3. Right company\n\nGood: I’ve spoken with Person X and Person Y about ExampleCo, and they both raved about how willing the company is to invest in employee’s growth.\n\nBad: ExampleCo has a great culture.\n\n## 4. Right conversation\n\nCome in with specific questions, not open ended.\n\nGood: I think the most important next steps for my business are X, Y, Z. I’d like to see if you agree, and talk about some strategy for X because you’ve used that tactic extensively in the past.\n\nBad: I want to learn more about your experience.\n\n## 5. Offer to help (optional)\n\nGood: It looks like your design team does a lot of user testing. Would it help if I was a tester in your next UX experiment?\n\nBad: I’d be happy to help if I can.\n\nBad: I'd love to help however I can.\n\n![Example cold email to Patrick McKenzie that nails the first five tacts of cold emailing. What's the one thing you should never do in a presentation? Put a huge amount of text on the slide and read it verbatim.](https://i.imgur.com/sq8jOW3.png)\n\nThe next four are logistical.\n\n## 6. Offer times, and 7. Offer a venue\n\nMake sure you've got:\n\n* the timezone\n* times during the workday, in the evening, and on the weekend\n* send it far in the future. People don't know if they're busy in 2 weeks, so it's easier to accept\n* give the perception that you're busy. \"I can do any time Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Please please please call me.\" is bad\n\nGood: I can jump into a 15 minute phone conversation (all times PST) Thursday between 3PM and 7PM, Saturday between 2PM and 8PM, or Monday between 8AM and 11AM.\n\nCalls or video conferences are less commitment and easier to say yes to. More commitment drinks or dinner is harder to say yes to but can create a stronger bond.\n\n## 8. Send at the right time and 9. Follow up at least once\n\n![Don't get lost in the Monday pile of giant email. Tuesdays are good.](https://i.imgur.com/J8zLDMs.jpg)\n\nTry using [Less Annoying CRM](https://www.lessannoyingcrm.com/) and [Monica](#) to keep track of\n\n![Recap](https://i.imgur.com/k9ZrRG4.png)\n",

Mike's communication strategy that can get a 30% reply rate.\n2. How to know what someone is thinking when they haven't replied to you.\n3. A sample followup email sequence you can use to get your customers to do anything.\n\n# Mike Taber\n\n![Bluetick.io](https://i.imgur.com/gPNd31R.png)\n\nMike is the cohost of the [Startups for the Rest of Us](https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/) podcast, the author of [The Single Founder Handbook](https://www.singlefounderhandbook.com/), the cohost and cofounder of [Microconf](https://www.microconf.com/), and (most recently) the founder of [Bluetick.io](https://bluetick.io/) - a SaaS that automates followup emails.\n\n# Why follow up?\n\nFollowing up with someone gives you more information and insight into your recipient's internal state. When you follow up, you can push someone forward on a decision.\n\n![The communication loop.](https://i.imgur.com/b74CzZ2.png)\n\nThere are four things you want to know when following up:\n\n1.  Was your message received?\n2.  Did they understand it? Do they know what they're supposed to do next?\n3.  Did they make a decision?\n4.  Did they inform you of that decision?\n\nThe purpose of following up is to close that loop.\n\nYou're really trying to figure out what you need to do to help them get to the next step. If they've already made a decision, you need them to tell you or your email gets sucked into the black hole.\n\nIf you're not answering these questions, your email is getting sent into the void - the email black hole.\n\n# What happens on the Other End\n\nhttps://twitter.com/patio11/status/966283826686144513\n\nThere are three main reasons why people don't reply to emails even if they're important. The only way you can know is if you email them to follow up.\n\n### The email wasn't received\n\nMail server issues (which are surprisingly common) might have blocked the email from going through, you might be sending to the wrong email address, the recipient might have aggressive spam filters on their inbox, or they might not be checking their email.\n\n### The email was received, but dismissed\n\nYour recipient's inbox might have received your email but saw it as irrelevant.\n\nInbox filters might have automatically deleted or archived it, a human gatekeeper might have scanned the subject line or email and thought it was unimportant, or your recipient might have been scared by too much information.\n\nIf you CC'd other addresses, your recipient might also think the email doesn't need an action from them.\n\n### The email was received with best of intentions, but not acted upon\n\nPerhaps your recipient meant to reply but couldn't. They could be traveling, or working remotely on a mobile device.\n\nIf it's been a few days since they think a reply was expected, they may feel guilty or anxious for not replying right away. In that case, followups give them permission to reply.\n\nIf your recipient's inbox is flooded, they may have declared [email bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_bankruptcy) and can only deal with tasks that are on fire.\n\n# Why don't we follow up?\n\n![Sending followup emails can feel like you're setting yourself up for failure.](https://i.imgur.com/l9yVLEs.jpg)\n\nPsychologically, it can be difficult to push yourself to send followup emails. There are four main causes behind followup email resistance.\n\nYou want emails to look like they were personally sent.\n\n## Incorrect value association\n\nA followup email is valuable if it does something valuable for the sender or recipient. Even if followup emails generate valuable results for you, if a long time passes between hitting \"send\" and getting the value, it can be difficult to associate sending the followup email with getting the valuable result.\n\nThe longer it takes to get a response in this delayed feedback loop, the harder it is to associate the value you got with sending followups.\n\n## Time constraints\n\nSending emails can feel like busywork, especially if followup sequences are growing exponentially.\n\nIf you start a daily followup campaign with five new people per day, you could be sending out 50 emails on day 10.\n\n## Your emotions get the better of you\n\nSending follow up emails can be emotionally painful. If you get a negative response to a followup email you sent, even if you've also gotten positive responses your negative emotions disproportionately outweighing the positive ones.\n\n## You're afraid\n\nYou don't want to be lumped into the category of dirt bags that relentlessly send spammy followup emails. It's easy to feel fear of the public shaming of sending bad emails.\n\n<!-- ![Douglas Adams probably didn't follow up in emails](https://i.imgur.com/8eCTxtl.jpg) -->\n\n# Follow up strategies that actually work\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SamNeter/status/968090271421534208\n\nMike Taber's SaaS app, Bluetick.io, helps automate sending followup emails. Over 70,000 emails, he's helped his customers achieve:\n\n- open rates between 26.7% up to almost 100%\n- an average reply rate of 5.9%, and a top reply rate of almost 30%\n\nThis data is skewed by blocked tracking pixels. Between 0% and 62.5% of recipients block email tracking, depending on the audience.\n\nHow have Mike's customers gotten such great numbers? By focusing on closing the reply loop and optimizing their followup emails.\n\nHere are four specific followup strategies for getting higher response rates.\n\n## When is a followup worth it?\n\nSelect the situations where it makes sense and the schedule to follow up. After you've first contacted someone and immediately after you've done a demo work well.\n\nHave you already followed up with a cold lead five times with no response? At that point, it probably isn't worth the effort of following up anymore.\n\n![Bad personalization is worse than no personalization.](https://i.imgur.com/1IX1UTg.jpg)\n\n## Personalization\n\nMake it appear that your followup email was sent only to your recipient.\n\nUsing their name and sending emails from your own domain make emails feel more personal.\n\nReplying to previous emails you've sent proves you've sent previous emails, which shows that you're working to get a response, and adds personalization.\n\n## Clearly define an Action\n\nClearly define the single action you want the person to take. Do you want them to schedule a call? Hit reply? If you're not clear, your recipient will likely get confused and take no action.\n\n## Automate your sequence\n\nTemplates, software, reminders, Zapier, and outsourcing done in a way that doesn't appear to be automated ensure your followup emails get sent.\n\nBe careful not to start an email with \"Hi ,\" or \"Hi $FNAME\" - that makes it clear you're not actually personally replying.\n\n## Example email sequence\n\nBelow is an example email sequence sent to a Bluetick lead to close the loop on scheduling a demo.\n\nEmail 1:\n\n_Hi Lori,_\n\n_I saw you heard about us on the B2B Growth podcast and were interested in using Bluetick for job searches._\n\n_Would you like to hop on a short call to get a quick demo of Bluetick and ask any questions about how to integrate it into your process? If so, here's a link to my calendar to set up a call: LINK_\n\n_Thanks and I'll talk to you soon._\n\nEmail 2:\n\n_Hi Lori,_\n\n_Have you had a chance to look at your calendar and see if there's a good time for us to chat about Bluetick?_\n\n_Let me know and we'll go from there. Thanks!_\n\nEmail 3:\n\n_Hi Lori,_\n\n_Are you still interested in taking a look at Bluetick to see if it will fit into your current followup process?_\n\n_I'd like to get on a call and discuss it with you if you have a few minutes. Thanks and talk to you soon._\n\nEmail 4:\n\n_Hi Lori,_\n\n_I'm sure you've been busy but I wanted to touch base to see if automating your followups was still on your radar. Based on the survey you filled out about how you're doing things, it seemed to me like Bluetick would be a good fit for you._\n\n_Has something changed or are you still interested in taking a look? Let me know either way._\n\n# Questions\n\n**How do you send breakup emails?**\n\n_A typical breakup email comes at the end of an automated sequence and says \"hey I've sent you several emails, I can see you're not interested, so I'll never email you again\". This closes the door to emailing them in the future._\n\n_A better reply is \"hey, I can see this isn't a good time for you. I'll followup again in 6 weeks\" because it shows your recipient that you're committed and keeps the door open to email them again._\n\n**I'm worried about an automated system following up when I've already followed up manually. How often do automated reply systems go awry?**\n\n_Automated systems can go awry a lot. If your call to action doesn't apply if you've had another interaction (ex: \"let's schedule a call\" when you've already had a call), you should trigger those followups manually._\n\n_Once the illusion of personal responses has been destroyed, your response rates go way down._\n\n**Do you legally have to have an \"unsubscribe\" link in automated emails? Is that a tell that you're not personally sending the emails?**\n\n_It is a tell, and you're toeing the line legally either way. You can still break the law even if you have an unsubscribe link. Bluetick doesn't include them by default._\n\n_Legally, there are three categories of email:_\n\n1.  _Transactional: you just bought something, so I sent you a receipt_\n2.  _Commercial: I'm trying to get you to buy something. This is where CANN spam laws come into play._\n3.  _Other (good job naming this one, government)_\n\n_Most email providers make you include an unsubscribe link so their entire server doesn't get IP blacklisted, not for legal reasons._\n\n**What's the best communication channel to followup: phone, text, email, or social?**\n\n_All of them - [multichannel marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multichannel_marketing)! There's a lot of value following up in different channels._\n\n_Bluetick is working on more channel integrations._\n\nContact Mike at [mike@bluetick.io](mailto:mike@bluetick.io) and check out the free 6-part [Learn How to Automate Your Followups](https://bluetick.io/course-learn-how-to-automate-your-followups/) email course from Bluetick.\n\n<iframe sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://lan.io/blog/podcast/mike-taber/embed/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"700\" title=\"Rob Walling Recap Interview - Lanio\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\"></iframe>\n<script type='text/javascript'>const wp = document.querySelector(\".wp-embedded-content\"); window.addEventListener(\"message\", ({data, origin}) => {if(origin === \"https://lan.io\" && data && data.message === \"height\" && data.value) wp.height = data.value})</script>\n",

Unlike the traditional Silicon Valley narrative of \"you have to crush code and grind through your twenties to ever be successful,\" Microconf encourages a more life-heavy balance. Mojca decided to fill her life with fast cars instead of children, and her and her husband have a fur baby named Jackie.](https://i.imgur.com/3ErZhkr.jpg)\n\n## About Mojca\n\nMojca works with 7-figure companies to help them build, launch, and run Facebook ad campaigns.\n\nMojca got started by launching a productized service (\"Super Spicy Sessions\") doing teardowns of social media profiles for her clients. When she launched, everyone in the Facebook advertising industry focused on Business to Consumer (B2C) ads because common sense said that Business to Business (B2B) Facebook ads were a bad idea.\n\nMojca invested 10% of her clients' fee for Super Spicy Sessions in Facebook ads and saw success, so she wondered why more companies weren't advertising on Facebook.\n\n# Facebook Ads Introduction\n\nWhen asked why they don't advertise on Facebook, most companies respond:\n\n- Facebook ads are too complicated (\"I don't know where to start!\")\n- Facebook ads are too time-consuming (\"It takes hours to launch one campaign!\")\n- Facebook ads are too expensive (\"I spent $1k and nothing happened!\")\n\nThese are bad excuses with simple solutions. Focus instead on the potential benefits of Facebook ads: a few years ago - before google, twitter, and Facebook - it was really hard to get a potential customer to see your ad. Today, you can get your message in front of exactly who you want for $10!\n\nTo grow your business, take advantage of this technology.\n\n![Facebook Pixel installation guide #small](https://i.imgur.com/F7HKRBU.png)\n\n## Start Tracking Now\n\nEven if you don't plan to advertise on Facebook soon, spend two minutes [installing the Facebook Pixel](https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel) - a code that lets you track your audience's behavior. You'll need it installed before you run your first campaign, and you'll have a much easier start if you've let Facebook collect traffic data for a while first.\n\n## Why Most Facebook Ad Campaigns Fail\n\nFacebook campaigns usually fail by:\n\n1.  **Selling to cold audiences**: you wouldn't knock on a stranger's door and ask them to buy your $50 e-book - they wouldn't trust you! Selling to cold audiences is a bad idea because you haven't built any trust or authority.\n2.  **Trying to close the deal too quickly**: someone that has visited your homepage isn't a customer prospect. You need to build up more trust before trying to make the sale.\n3.  **Optimizing for the wrong metrics**: instead of optimizing for clicks, optimize for the core metric you want to improve. Sales or app downloads are better metrics than clicks.\n\n# Facebook Advertising Funnel\n\n![Facebook Ad Funnel](https://i.imgur.com/WoG1mKx.png)\n\nA typical Facebook Ad funnel, like any sales funnel, typically has three layers:\n\n1.  Attract visitors\n2.  Generate leads\n3.  Close sales\n\nEach of these layers represents a separate campaign.\n\nFor each campaign, ask yourself these four questions to craft the perfect message:\n\n1. **Goal**: what are you trying to achieve?\n2. **Asset**: what are you promoting?\n3. **Audience**: who do you want to reach?\n4. **Approach**: how are you going to achieve your goal?\n\nLet's walk through each of those four questions for each of the three layers of the Facebook Ad sales funnel.\n\n![\"How to get paid 100% Upfront\" is a powerful headline because it sparks the audience's interest. The copy came directly from his audience.](https://i.imgur.com/jL6MsxZ.jpg)\n\n## 1. Attract Visitors\n\n### 1.1. Goal\n\nWhen reaching out to a cold audience, make the first connection through value. Give your audience something they want and you'll start building trust with them. Establish yourself as a professional with authority on a topic.\n\nThis is also where you can start tracking your audience with the Facebook Pixel on your site so you can re-target them later.\n\n### 1.2. Asset\n\nGive your audiences something valuable right away. Your promoted asset should be something they can implement themselves and start seeing results.\n\nBlog posts and videos are great forms of assets to promote. A 5-minute video recorded on your phone is fine as long as you're talking about something valuable to your audience.\n\nIf you don't know what to promote, look at which of your blog posts have gotten the most traffic and start promoting them.\n\n### 1.3. Cold Audience\n\nAt the first stage of your Facebook Ad funnel, you're targeting a cold audience and want to try to reach as many people as possible.\n\nThere are two approaches you can take:\n\n- **Interest Targeting**: target people based on what they like. For example, profiles that have liked one of your competitor's pages, or a page of a business in a similar space.\n- **Lookalike Audiences**: upload your existing customer email list and Facebook can find more people that are similar to your existing audience based on geography, age, gender, interests, and all other data Facebook keeps on profiles.\n\n_Note from Christian: advertisers are the true customer of Facebook. It's a fantastic service for it's intended customer._\n\n### 1.4. Approach\n\nBrand your promoted posts with your design (logo and colors) so people remember you.\n\nUse a powerful headline that sparks people's interest. \"How to get paid 100% Upfront\" is a powerful headline that came directly from Jonathan Stark's audience.\n\n---\n\n![A great lead generation ad. Specific language, branded design, clear call to action - join egghead!](https://i.imgur.com/inCyL4U.png)\n\n## 2. Generate Leads\n\n### 2.1. Goal\n\nOnce you've captured someone's attention, your goal is to get them to make their first transaction with you by giving you their email address. This builds more trust and further establishes you as an authority.\n\nThis transaction separates people who _might_ be interested but are just lurking from qualified leads that want more.\n\n### 2.2 Asset\n\nMake sure your asset is actually valuable to your audience. It can take the form of:\n\n- An ebook\n- A Cheat Sheet\n- A Checklist\n- An Email course\n- A Free Trial\n\nThis asset should be another tool your audience can immediately use to get a quick win.\n\n### 2.3. Retargeted Audience\n\nAt this level of your funnel, target people that have expressed an interest in you. Look for:\n\n- Blog post readers\n- Top web page visitors\n- Contact page visitors (they were actively looking for a way to contact you!)\n\n### 2.4. Approach\n\nWhat pain are you solving for your audience? What will their outcome be from this asset? What's their next actionable step to get that outcome?\n\nMake sure your asset is clearly answering these questions and makes it clear what action you want your audience to take.\n\n![A great lead-generation ad for a time tracking app for construction companies. This ad reiterates its audience's pain - \"no more repetitive tasks and hand-written time cards\" - and has a clear call to action - \"sign up.\" #large](https://i.imgur.com/dcre370.png)\n\n---\n\n![A closing ad from Egghead selling their pro membership. This ad speaks directly to its audience of developers, addresses specific pain they have (\"Do you remember those boring 8-hour courses you had to sit through?\"), communicates value (focused professional knowledge video lessons), and has a clear call to action (\"become a pro member\").](https://i.imgur.com/hDq1KGB.png)\n\n## 3. Close Sales\n\n### 3.1. Goal\n\nOnce you've gotten an audience past the first two levels of your sales funnel, it's easy to make the final sale. Your goal here is to close sales.\n\n### 3.2. Asset\n\nRestaurants start you with a tiny appetizer then work up to the main course. It's hard to sell your premium expensive product (like your $5k consulting) right away. It's much easier to start with a small offering (a \"tripwire product\") and scale up later.\n\n### 3.3. Retargeted Audience\n\nFor the third layer of your sales funnel, try targeting:\n\n- Existing Leads\n- Pricing and Sales Page Visitors: maybe they forgot to buy! Maybe they were on their iPhone and couldn't make the purchase (Facebook can track people between their devices)\n\n### 3.4. Approach\n\nThe more specifically you can talk to your audience, the more effective you'll be able to sell them. If your audience at this stage is CEOs of construction companies, you can talk directly and specifically to them.\n\nCommunicate what your audience is going to get out of this offer. Show them social proof and testimonials. Use their own words in your copy.\n\n![CEO Warrior is a coaching company for service business providers. This ad uses words that came directly from customer interviews. #large](https://i.imgur.com/WXb16ND.png)\n\n![This ad from ClockShark converts like crazy. ClockShark's audience has a big problem with paper timesheets. This ad uses specific strong copy that came directly from customer interviews (\"Paper time sheets are messy. And you hate them\", \"you end up wasting even more time going through them, trying to make sense of it all\"), lists its specific features and cost, has a clear call to action (\"get rid of paper timecards today and start using the newest time-tracking technology with ClockShark\"), and a testimonial. Anyone can say \"my software is the best\" - testimonials from real customers are more effective. #large](https://i.imgur.com/LZKwjOF.jpg)\n\n# Summary\n\n![Facebook ad qualifying process #large](https://i.imgur.com/mTDiskf.png)\n\nFacebook ads can convert a complete stranger into a prospect by offering them value. A prospect with a lead magnet can convert into a lead. A lead converts into a customer 💸\n\nThis process is hard, so stay determined. Did your first blog post become viral? Was your first business amazing and really successful? It's going to take you a couple of times. Don't give up!\n\n# Questions\n\n**Facebook cuts long copy off at 2 lines. Is it worth doing really long copy? Your images also had a lot of text, which Facebook doesn't like.**\n\n_I know it sounds weird, but people read long copy.

How?\n\nOver this growth, Vengage has focused on organic traffic and content marketing.\n\n# About Nadya\n\nNadya got a theatre degree in a program without a script - the direction was just to \"make a great story\".\n\n> Make a show and tell a great story.\n\nHaving too much freedom can be stunting. In this theatre program, Nadya and her classmates focused on their limitations. What were they not allowed to do?\n\nBy focusing on their limitations, they could be more creative.\n\n# What is Viral?\n\nContent that is circulated rapidly and widely from one web user to another.\n\nWhen making viral content, most people focus on clickbaity titles. This will get a bunch of content generated, but it won't be quality content that actually engages users.\n\n## How do you create quality content?\n\nInstead of focusing on what to do (\"create engaging and thought provoking content\"), ask _how_.\n\nAsk how to:\n\n* leave your readers with questions\n* write a promising intro\n* how to tell a compelling story\n\n---\n\n# 12 Principles\n\n## 1. Solve a burning problem\n\nWhat problems are your users facing? Use those questions to fuel the content you're creating.\n\nWhy are reddit AMAs so successful? It gives people outlets to ask successful people existing questions.\n\n![Solve a burning problem by providing new answers to existing questions](https://i.imgur.com/sdrbye2.png)\n\n## 2. Find hacks to common struggles\n\nWhat makes \"The Magic Art of Tidying Up\" better than other guides to house cleaning? The solution is framed as a _magical solution_.\n\n\"Does this thing spark joy?\" is a great magic wand to solve a complex problem. This is better than a litmus test of \"have you used it in the last 6 months?\" because it's hard to think back for each item over the last 6 months. It's easy to ask yourself if a thing sparks joy.\n\n> Find hacks to common struggles by offering a simplified solution for completing a task\n\nWhy did 17M people watch [How to Fold a shirt in 15 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz6rjbw0ZA0)? It's 1) a common task we're all familiar with, and 2) a simplified way of doing it.\n\nWhat tasks is your audience doing on a daily basis, and how could you give them a hack to their common struggle?\n\n## 3. Bust a myth\n\nDisprove a \"common knowledge\" theory.\n\nEx: [Millennials Don’t Suck, You’re Just Old and Hate Change [Infographic]\n](https://venngage.com/blog/millennials-infographic/)\n\nBy busting a myth, you encourage debate, get more links, get more shares, and get more recognition\n\n![By busting a myth, you encourage debate, get more links, get more shares, and get more recognition](https://i.imgur.com/RTnG90b.png)\n\n## 4. Challenge the Status Quo\n\nSimilarly to busting a myth, challenging the status quo gets people talking about you, and get better brand recognition.\n\n## 5. Reframe the Question\n\nIdentify what the question is, then approach it from a different angle.\n\nExample: [The World's deadliest animals](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Most-Lethal-Animal-Mosquito-Week) reframes the question of \"why is the malaria vaccination important\" by reframing the question to \"what are the world's deadliest animals\"\n\n## 6. Bring in a New Perspective\n\nMove away from the traditional perspective to explore topics through a new lens.\n\nEveryone talks about [Stephen Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry)'s percentage of shots taken, performance, and 3-point game.\n\nHow could you stand out? Talk about NBA Unicorns! Talk about the economics of Stephen Curry! Talk about how CEOs work compared to athletes!\n\n## 7. Mashup Multiple Topics\n\nCombine trending themes with evergreen themes.\n\nIs Star Wars trending? [Combine it with the evergreen theme of good design.](https://venngage.com/blog/7-design-principles-star-wars-taught-us-infographic/)\n\n![Combine trending themes with evergreen themes, like Design and Star Wars](https://i.imgur.com/S9e51e1.jpg)\n\n## 8. Go outside of your immediate field\n\nBroaden your scope to talk about more general problems in your field.\n\n![Look for more general problems in your field](https://i.imgur.com/u5rPJCz.png)\n\n## 9. Find niches and subcultures to comment on\n\nPeople tend to become very obsessive about their subcultures, and those subcultures can grow very quickly.\n\n## 10. Explore and Visualize Origin Stories\n\nOrigin stories are some of the most engaging and inspiring. Think of aspects within your industry that have an interesting history and tell that story!\n\n> For every topic, there is always an origin story.\n\nOrigin stories like \"Marvel's Daredevil\", \"Marvel's Luke Cage\", and \"Marvel's Jessica Jones\" are some of the top viewed Netflix original shows (and some of the highest grossing films in Hollywood).\n\n## 11. Envision the Before and After State\n\n![Help your customer get to a better state](https://i.imgur.com/FWOaM7O.png)\n\nCompare your user's state before and after for what they have, how they feel, what an average day looks like, and what their status is. Here's an example with baby bathtubs:\n\n![Before and after having a baby bathtub](https://i.imgur.com/bsjk4Qb.png)\n\n> Babies are slippery or something, right? This is what I assume it's like to have children - just a constant struggle of \"will I drop it?\"\n\n## 12. Include a reason to share\n\nAsk yourself why your audience should share your content. Will it help them better express themselves?\n\nTrump tweets are viral because people care about what he says. They speak, write and act in response to that care.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385\n\n> When people care, they speak, write and act in response to that care.\n\n# Recap\n\n1.  Solve a burning problem\n2.  Find hacks to common struggles\n3.  Bust a myth\n4.  Challenge the status quo\n5.  Reframe the question\n6.  Bring in a new perspective\n7.  Mashup multiple topics\n8.  Go outside your immediate field\n9.  Find niches and subcultures\n10. Explore origin stories\n11. Envision the before and after state\n12. Include a reason to share\n\nAlso, get a free design at [venngage.com/blog/microconf](https://venngage.com/blog/microconf)\n\n---\n\n# Questions\n\n**Has there ever been a pushback from JK Rowling or Star Wars for mashing up their content?**\n\nNah, they're too big to care.\n\n**Have you created content around a very technical topic**\n\nYes - content around our own tools capabilities, like twitter analytics data.\n",

    "body": "\n![Patrick Collison at Microconf Growth 2018](https://i.imgur.com/H0XrmwJ.jpg)\n\nStripe is a big company - how do they fit into Microconf? They embody the bootstraper ethos - they took it a long way as two dudes in a garage with minimal funding.\n\n> For several months, John slept in the garden of our one bedroom apartment.\n\n**Today at Microconf you launched [LLCs on Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/llc-vs-c-corp) - congrats!**\n\nFor a while, the top feature request of [Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas) has been to support LLCs (a relatively new invention).\n\nWe want Atlas to work well for companies that are going to do well, and not a lot of huge companies are LLCs, but early on in a company you don't know what's going to happen. C-corps have a lot of overhead.\n\nLLCs have a lot of options, so fit the ethos of the bootstrapper community better.\n\n**You've launched [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas), now [Stripe LLC](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/llc-vs-c-corp), the Software engineering magazine [Increment](https://increment.com/), and acquired [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/). These seem as an outsider like random things - can you comment on the overall umbrella of these?**\n\nSo many times in building Stripe, some stupid little speedbump almost stopped it from happening. Our thinking of building Stripe is to increase the number of internet businesses.\n\nWhat determins the number of internet businesses in the world? Why is it that number instead of half that many or twice as many?\n\nAs far as we can tell, it's just a lot of these smaller roadbumps.\n\nWe're very inspired in the things Indie Hackers et. al are doing because we think it's making it easier to start businesses.\n\n60% of customers on Atlas said they wouldn't have started their business if Atlas didn't exist, so we're continuing to look for opportunities like that.\n\n> You don't need to be Mark Zuckerberg to do something incredibly meaningful.\n\nThere's a prevailing Ayn Randian idea of entrepreneurs as lone committed furrowplower, whereas the reality is that the community of people around you that understand your problems is underrated.\n\n**Word of mouth of Stripe spread fast. Was that a deliberate decision on your and [John](https://twitter.com/collision)'s part, or did it just happen because you had a great product?**\n\nWe lucked out. The things we were competing against were comically bad. Our competitors forced you to fax things to them.\n\n> Our competitors were like comic book villains - our competitors forced you to fax things to them\n\nThe banking industry when we started was a lot like the healthcare industry is right now. We all roll our eyes at the current solutions knowing that someone is going to come along and roll over the existing market with a much better product.\n\nThere's a thing that happens to people writing in a corporate voice - they start talking about synnergy and use a whole other vocabulary. We tried to avoid that at Stripe. Expressing yourself honestly isn't something you can generalize, and it lands with people.\n\n**Are there any other marketing channels you've explored that have worked well?**\n\nWe don't have a great track record with names (Stripe was almost paydaemon or `/dev/payments`).\n\nMost users discovered Stripe through our integrations with other products, and those integrations were possible because we had great APIs. We think our expertise is in making APIs (and definitely not naming things).\n\n---\n\n# Questions\n\n**You've talked about very small customers on Stripe Atlas and sophisticated customers - how do you build your product so the new people aren't overwhelmed but the huge customers are still getting what they want?**\n\nThat's **the** core challenge of Stripe. Every feature you add makes the product worse for people who don't use that feature.\n\nStripe should be able to scale through every order of magnitude - from your first to your ten-millionth payment.\n\nI'm pretty sure the right strategy is to go serve the customer at every scale, but how do you do that?\n\nThere are several torturous tactics we use, like partitioning features, using dynamic documentation that just shows you what we think you care about, slowly rolling out features, and using dynamic dashboards that only show you certain things in the sidebar.\n\nWe don't yet have a grand unified theory of how to scale like this - it's becoming an increasingly active discussion.\n\n**How much of your success do you attribute to being in Silicon Valley? Could you have had the same success outside of Silicon Valley?**\n\nBecause we're serving technology companies, we're in a unique position of needing to be around other technology companies.\n\n> I think a smaller fraction of the world's best engineers are outside Silicon Valley now than in the last four years.\n\nI think it's less worthwhile to be in Silicon Valley now than in the last four years. One reason for this is that the cost of living is too high. Collaboration tools are also shifting the calculus towards distributed teams working better than they used to.\n\nThere are also top tier developers all over the world.\n\nIn the next twenty years, we're probably going to see less successful technology companies in Silicon Valley and more around the world.\n\n**Do you support open source projects out of goodwill, or are you getting an ROI from it?**\n\nA lot of things in the world aren't measurable but still have huge benefits.\n\nAt Stripe, we believe in improving open source software and projects like Indie Hackers even though we can't measure the ROI - it just feels important to us. Open source software isn't taken seriously enough by companies benefiting from it.\n\n**How'd you deal with financial regulation?**\n\nIt was very difficult to convince a bank to partner with us - most of them were like 🙅‍.\n\n> We were like three squirrels in a trenchcoat masquerading as a real business.\n\nThere's nothing special about us, though - we were just two guys from Ireland with no connections. Anyone could do this.\n\n**Fraud and chargebacks suck - how are you guys thinking about that?**\n\n> If your chargebacks give you heartburn, imagine seeing all of them.\n\nIt's net good that they exist because it gives consumers confidence to give a rando business their credentials to charge them. It's a great extension of trust that customers have this recourse.\n\nThere are fewer disputes per charge than there ever have been in the past - we think we'll get substantially better still over the next 12 months. Ultimately, though, there's something unsolvable there. It does need to remain easy for consumers to dispute a purchase. What interests me is if structurally we can move beyond that, but it's a complex ecosystem to shepherd.\n\nWe welcome feedback - positive or negative - at patrick@stripe.com. Please email me!\n",

His first Microconf was in 2011.\n\nThe Microconf mentality lets us lead the lives we want to live. Having a great business means you can be more present for our families and our communities, and have a better way of working. It's not just _how_ you do it, it's also _why_ you do it - don't loose sight of that.\n\nThe title of this talk - Your First 60 Days - is misleading. What you do over your first 60 days is important, but not nearly as important as what you do consistently over a 40 year career.\n\nKeep an eye on the long game of providing value to your community and capturing value for yourself.\n\n---\n\n## Decision making over the long haul\n\n![#small](https://i.imgur.com/OdpUqPd.png)\n\nDecision paralysis as a founder can be worse than making the wrong decision. Instead of agonizing over perfection, it's almost always better to just ship ideas and see if they worked.\n\n- **Make more small bets.** Not ever decision you make _needs_ to be the right one, so make decisions in a way that optimizes for learning. Very little of what you do in business are \"trapdoor\" (irreversible) decisions.\n- **Decide quickly** on reversible things that don't matter in the long run. Don't agonize about if you've hit perfection, just get it out the door. Making more decisions faster and learning from them is a better strategy than trying to make the perfect decision every time.\n- **Maximize for the long term.** You have a sharply limited amount of time as an entrepreneur - do things that will still matter and be relevant 40 years from now.\n\n### Grinding, duh\n\nHow are you going to build a business in the next 60 days? Easy - you're going to grind.\n\nYou don't need to be an expert, or have the perfect long term grand strategy, or know what you're doing: you need to go out there every day doing repetitive things that generate small amounts of value, and you need to keep doing it a lot over a long amount of time.\n\n## What should I build?\n\n\"What should I build\" is the wrong question to ask first. Instead, ask \"who do I want to serve?\"\n\nWhat people communities do you feel a calling towards? Don't look at building a business as a quick way to make money, look at it as a big part of your life for several years. The audience you pick will have a huge impact on your quality of life.\n\nPatrick made the mistake of not choosing the people he would be serving first with a business that made a service for dental offices. Did he feel like he could bounce up every morning with enthusiasm at the prospect of talking to dental offices? Oh God no!\n\n\"Oh God no!\" is the wrong reaction to have when thinking about your customers. To maximize your quality of life and chance of success in business, don't serve people you feel contempt for.\n\nInstead, choose to serve people:\n\n- ...**who you're energized in talking to**. Who are you never tired to talk to? Who are you excited to work with? Patrick bounces with enthusiasm talking to Microconf people, and got really tired talking to teachers for the 6 years he ran [Bingo Card Creator](https://www.bingocardcreator.com/).\n- ...**whose problems are tractable**. Making a dent in global poverty is an awesome mission to have, and not one that a single person working really hard for several years can reasonably materially impact.\n- ...**with money**. Serve people who can afford to pay for your solutions, which usually means businesses. If you have charitable impulses, it's much easier and more effective to be charitable with a healthy business behind you than to undercharge.\n\n## Assemble your business piece-by-piece\n\n![Assemble your business piece-by-piece instead of striving for a perfect end state. #small](https://i.imgur.com/4CtYzts.jpg)\n\nIt's easy to look at currently successful businesses and think \"wow, they have it all figured out,\" which can be discouraging. In reality, everyone is making it up as they go.\n\nEven Patrick Collison - the cofounder of Stripe - has said that when going into early meetings with banks he felt like three squirrels in a trench coat.\n\nInstead of targeting a business that's all put together, focus on adding a little piece at a time, similar to putting together a puzzle (though a puzzle isn't a perfect analogy - there's no perfectly defined end state in business).\n\nView work on your business as snapping in another little puzzle piece that brings you towards a more finished product:\n\n- a little bit of marketing gets you a little more credibility\n- a little product development helps your customers to be a little more satisfied\n- a single conversation with a customer helps you understand their desires and needs a little better\n\nAdding small meaningful pieces every day that will still be there in several years is a great metric for success.\n\n## Talk to people\n\n![Patrick Collison cold-emailed Patrick McKenzie when Collison had first developed Stripe asking McKenzie to try it for Bingo Card Creator. Cold emailing, if you can do it, is a super useful entrepreneurial skill.](https://i.imgur.com/wxVcBTM.png)\n\nIt's never a bad time to talk to a customer or prospect. If you're capable of sending out cold emails, go for it.\n\nIf you hate setting up phone calls or emailing people, push through it. Talking to people is a tremendously important skill to develop as an entrepreneur.\n\n## Marketing platform before product\n\nBuild a marketing platform to engage an audience before you build a product. Like knowing how to cook, a marketing platform is a great way to always have friends.\n\nWhat does a marketing platform look like? At least:\n\n- **3 \"friend-catchers\"**: If you know how to cook (a friend-catcher from Patrick's mom), you'll never lack for friends. If you build something that solves problems for people, you'll never lack people to talk to who have problems.\n- **5 emails**: see the \"Email course cheat sheet\" section below for what these emails could look like\n- **~45 days of grinding**: build the habit of talking to people every day. You don't need a grand strategy or a fancy process, just send a few emails and tweets.\n\n### The ideal friend-catcher\n\n![The ideal friend-catcher fixes a problem which is tractable, resonant, and underserved. #small ](https://i.imgur.com/CUXI7C1.png)\n\nThe ideal friend-catcher solves a problem that is:\n\n- **Tractable**: To genuinely solve the problem your friend-catcher promises to solve, tackle problems that are manageable. \"How to solve global warming\" probably can't be solved in a 7,000 word guide, but [making more money with salary negotiation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) can.\n- **Resonant**: When your audience sees your friend-catcher exists, they should respond with \"oh EFF yes! This is exactly what I need!\" - that response means they're much more likely to share your friend-catcher. How do you find problems your audience will resonate with? Pay attention to the pains your audience has (ex: Javascript Developers feel visceral pain about build pipelines).\n- **Underserved**: There are many 101 guides to any topic, but 201 guides are scarce. There are many guides about specific technologies, but guides about how to use multiple related technologies together are scarce.\n\n### Great forms of friend-catchers\n\n![Amy Hoy's Ruby on Rails Cheat Sheet is the friend-catcher she used to befriend Patrick. #small](https://i.imgur.com/h7LWrYw.png)\n\nThings you're already good at making are likely great form catchers. If you're struggling for ideas on what specifically to build, try:\n\n- **Stick-a-fork-in-it-and-it-is-done guide**: Write the definitive guide on how to solve one broadly applicable and tightly scoped problem and people will use it for years.\n- **Excel-replacement Calculator**: Presenting a useful bit of math in a format that can be used by people who can't code is unreasonably effective. There's no calculation too trivial! (ex: [A/B testing statistical significance](https://abtestguide.com/calc/) is hard math for normal people)\n- **Definitive curated list of resources**: Plant a flag on the internet of a definitive list of everything great and outstanding in this field (ex: Josh Kaufman's [definitive list of the best business books](https://personalmba.com/best-business-books/)).\n- **Cheatsheets**: Amy Hoy made the Ruby on Rails Cheatsheet that turned her into a celebrity in the Rails community. Patrick was afraid to talk to her the first time he saw her in person because of her fame in making great friend-catcher cheat sheets.\n\n## Get their email\n\n![Stripe puts a call to action on every one of their friend-catchers.](https://i.imgur.com/p87GRIU.png)\n\nOn each of your friend-catchers, include a way to collect your audience's email addresses. You're effectively saying \"hey, if you like this, give me your email address so I can send you more things you like.\"\n\nMaking a call to action isn't rocket science. Make a promise for what you're going to give someone if they give you their email address, and add a field they can type their address in. This strategy is unreasonably effective at collecting people who have problems you can solve.\n\n## Email Literally Everyone\n\nIn your first 60 days of grinding, make a habit of looking at everyone who's signed up since yesterday and sending them a personal email: \"Hey, it's me! I'm unreasonably interested in this topic, and I'd love to chat with you about it.\"\n\nBeing able to individually email everyone on your list is a huge advantage that bigger companies don't have, so take advantage of it! As long as you can, make a personal connection with each member of your audience.\n\n## Email course cheat sheet\n\nHere's everything you need to know about putting together an email course:\n\n- **Make a promise with every subject line and overdeliver**. This is the one copywriting trick you need to know if you know no others.\n- **Write 75% of emails to educate and 25% to sell**. Sales emails work best on their own instead of getting hidden in educational content. Don't forget to ask for the freaking sale, even if it's embarrassing!\n- **Front-load delivery**. Your audience will be at their happiest right when they sign up, so immediately start providing value. Emailing ~3 times in the first week and ~6 times in the first month is fine.\n- **Email once ever 2-4 weeks after your email course ends**. After the end of the course, then you can back off so your audience can decide if they actually like you. Promise \"more things you like.\"\n\nThere's a world of people - find the people that love hearing from you, and establish the expectation that you'll be sending them more things they like.\n\nFor more on nailing email, check out Patrick's blog post [You Should Probably Send More Email Than You Do](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/05/31/can-i-get-your-email/) and his email training course [Hacking Lifecycle Emails for Software Companies](https://training.kalzumeus.com/lifecycle-emails). Patrick's course is free to anyone who has attended MicroConf - just [send him an email](mailto:patrick@kalzumeus.com) for access!\n\n### Checkpoints\n\nIn the beginning research phase, you should be doing nothing _but_ talking to customers. Try to hit:\n\n- **10 great conversations** - 25 for SaaS\n- **500 email addresses**. Don't worry about any kind of marketing automation until you have at least 500 people on your list - just keep writing.\n- **10 commits to buy** - 25 in SaaS - or you'll have a super hard time selling it.\n\nOnce you've done that, you can move into the doing-cool-stuff-with-your-business fun expressive work of actually building something, but talking to customers isn't something you can grow out of. If you stay in this business you're going to be researching and talking to customers for the rest of your life.\n\nWhy wait to hit those metrics? It's too easy to hide in the code cave for a few weeks that turn into months without talking to customers. Commit to talk to people first and you'll develop better habits while you're developing.\n\n## Objective external indicia of progress\n\nThe work you're able to get done in a given week is extremely limited. Patrick finds it useful to organize his week like a dinner plate to combat business ADD:\n\n- **one main dish** - the main thing you want to accomplish this week, taking up half your dinner plate.\n- **two side dishes** - two things you want to get done that will likely get done this week, each taking up a quarter of your dinner plate.\n- **dessert** - everything else. Don't expect to get any desserts done.\n\nOne of your three weekly allocated spots on your dinner plate should be something you don't like but need to do, and one should always be talking to customers.\n\nFor every piece of work you do (except talking to customers), you should have some type of of progress that's published like a tweet or an article.\n\n## Build the actual thing\n\nYou're likely interested in this content because you already have the skill of building things pretty dialled in.\n\nIf you're feeling imposter syndrome, remember that building an awesome thing doesn't mean building the _best_ thing. Your thing doesn't have to be a work of outstanding genius that will be studied 200 years from now.\n\nThe bar for businesses in the economy is _just_ above making something so bad you get sued. This is disconcerting and freeing.\n\n### Abuse your advantages\n\nPatrick was applying for a mortgage in Japan and was worried he'd be racially stereotyped by Japanese banks. His real estate broker said \"don't worry - I got this,\" and followed through with 4 out of 4 approvals.\n\nPatrick thought he'd just gotten lucky, but his loan officer let Patrick know that he had talked to every loan officer for two hours on Patrick's behalf, because \"this is what I do.\"\n\n**\"This is what I do\"** is an amazing sales message. You can become the person that's unreasonably good at the details of an esoteric topic, which quickly builds trust with customers.\n\nEven if you just spend 60 days on a topic, you'll probably quickly become the world's leading expert in that specific thing. How many people are studying javascript pipelines?\n\n**Be _irrationally_ responsive to customers**, especially in the beginning. Huge businesses have very complex processes involving low paid employees. You can do _so_ much better than that as an independent business owner every time because you're not just head of customer support making outlandish promises, you're the lead engineer that can fulfill those promises a week later.\n\n**Move fast and _make things_**. Most companies in the world don't have a development team capable of making _anything_, or a marketing team capable of _selling anything_. You can build things that both increase the value of the thing you're building _and_ increase your ability to market and sell that thing. For more on this topic, check out Patrick's past Microconf talk [Building Things To Help Sell The Things You Build](https://vimeo.com/72140534).\n\n## Charge more\n\n![Reasonable product pricing floors that work.](https://i.imgur.com/7rCqbcz.png)\n\nCharging more will get you more money, get you better customers, and attract people who you want to serve.\n\nHow much more should you charge? Whatever your number is right now, raise it.\n\nIf you charge in tiers, you can segment out customers getting outstanding value from you. Health Care businesses care much more about backups than other industries, so let them pay you more.\n\n# Boring Business Advice\n\n## Immediately\n\n- get a new **business credit card** and put every business expense on it to make accounting a lot easier\n- sign up for business **gmail/google apps account** for custom email addresses (ex: `accounts@${domain}`, `receipts@${domain}`) to organize incoming email and make it easier to transfer all of your accounts to someone else\n- use a **password manager** as a reminder of what your passwords are _and_ what accounts you have.\n\n## Medium term\n\n- get an accountant - they'll make you the most amount of money of any professional you hire\n- find a peer group to talk shop with and meet regularly to bounce ideas off of\n- de-risk your family life with:\n  - Retirement savings. Check out [Wealth & Investing for Founders](https://leanpub.com/wealthforfounders) by John Knox at Microconf.\n  - Insurance. Both term life and long-term disability\n  - Go to the gym like it is your job\n\n## Stripe Atlas\n\nIf you're getting started, Patrick works with [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas) to help companies get up and running. They can help create a C-Corp, S-Corp, business bank account, and community of business people (including lawyers and accountants) to help you through problems.\n\n# Questions\n\n**Why don't you like blog posts?**\n\n_My blog has ~3M words on it, and it was a mistake._\n\n_Don't make one of your life commitments keeping it up to date. A dead blog is worse than no blog at all._\n\n_Instead of a blog, post articles on your website that are definite evergreen guides._\n\n**How did you become such a good storyteller?**\n\n![The Hero's Journey](https://i.imgur.com/SjbTPTH.png)\n\n_I'm the storyteller of my Irish Catholic family's generation. It seems to work for me for business so I lean into it._\n\n_I don't have a great guide other than grinding at it. Tell more stories!_\n\n_Try adopting narrative structure like [the hero's journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey)._\n\n**Do you hate B2C?**\n\n_I don't have an emotional hatred of B2C - I don't hate anyone anywhere. Hating people is a commitment of emotional energy in the future and I'd rather commit to positive things._\n\n_Google and Apple have a war chest of hundreds of billions of dollars. You can't beat them at the B2C game._\n\n_If you have to create a B2C, pick a demographic that has some money to pay and is super emotionally invested. Most consumers are pathologically bad at spending money on things. Pro-sumers like skaters who spend $800 on skates or [the guy who sold gaming tables](/chad-deshon) are better._\n\n**How do you split time spent talking to customers vs. building your product?**\n\n_It depends on where you are in the cycle. I do 50/25/25 to tactical marketing/talking to customers/product._\n\n_If I didn't have a laser focus of what the product is, I'd spend the 50 on talking to people. Do it first thing in the morning so you can do the trivial, easy, fun work of building stuff later._\n\n**My favorite talk is your [Hello Ladies talk from Business of software](https://vimeo.com/96701548) where you recommend building products for underserved audiences. How do you build things for people who aren't like you?**\n\n_Even software for software developers is a huge market opportunity - if you're building software for people similar to you, it's probably still a good market._\n\n_Some markets can't pay, so don't serve a market like that. A market like \"women in tech positions\" is a great underserved market._\n\nChat with patrick at @patio11, patrick@kalzumeus.com, or patio11@stripe.com.\n",

I am anti-everyone-thinking-venture-capital-is-the-only-way-to-start-a-tech-company.\n\n> If you’re self-funded with one or two founders, you can support your entire business from a tiny niche that provides $20k/month in revenue.\n\n> But with venture capital (or even... angel funding) you are forced to go after much larger markets. And a market that's 10x the size is 100x harder to get right. There’s more competition, more complexity, higher ad rates, etc.\n\nHaving done both bootstrapping and a funded business, Rob knows the good and bad parts of VC funding.\n\n# The Bad\n\n## 1. Communication is painful\n\nLaunching multiple features a week is much harder when you're not bootstrapped\n\n> At times I feel like I spend more time talking about building product than actually building product.\n\n## 2. Board meetings are a pain in the ass\n\n## 3. Culture is Hard\n\nWhen you hit 15 or 20 employees, culture gets really hard.\n\nIt's easy to do it badly (like with a [mission statement generator](http://www.joe-ks.com/archives_feb2001/ManualMSG.htm)).\n\nThe [Netflix Culture Document](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture) and [Balsamiq Culture Document](https://blog.balsamiq.com/mantras/) do it well.\n\n## 4. Hire for both skill and personality\n\nIf you hire just for skill, you get folks in who aren't a good fit.\n\nIf you hire just for personality, you have to train everyone and can't move very fast.\n\n## 5. Things Rob never had to deal with\n\nClassic things like raising funding, monthly reporting, annual audits, and legal complexities Rob didn't need to deal with.\n\n# The Good\n\n## 1. You can hire specialists\n\nSpecialists and partnerships give you a huge boost in growth and make it easier to run your company. Areas like HR, specialized developers, and GDPR are ripe for specialists.\n\n## 2. Pay Market Salaries\n\nEarly on, Rob lost a great developer because of a $10k difference in salary. Having more money means you don't need to make this compromise.\n\n![Being venture baked lets you pay market salaries](https://i.imgur.com/YA61Htz.png)\n\n## 3. Hire Senior Talent\n\nOnly being able to afford junior developers means you move much slower.\n\n![Only being able to afford junior developers means you move much slower.](https://i.imgur.com/Sf22YOe.png)\n\n## 4. Use a recruiter\n\nAs a bootstrapped founder, you don't realize how much of your time you spend on hiring.\n\n_If_ Rob starts another company, he'd hire a recruiter a lot earlier.\n\n## 5. Don't waste time to save a few dollars\n\nAs a bootstrapped founder, you feel compelled to penny pinch and save little dollar amounts in places like AWS, which is taking away focus from the rest of what you're trying to do.\n\n![Don't waste time to save a few dollars - just increase your revenue](https://i.imgur.com/FqqbHtY.jpg)\n\nWhat's wasted time? If you're evaluating Kayako or intercom and thinking mostly about price, you're probably wasting your time. Same for Zoho vs. Gmail, Wistia vs. Sprout Vieo, GoDaddy Hosting vs. WPEngine, etc.\n\n## 6. Use Standard Job Titles\n\nIn a bootstrapped company, you just make up job titles. Once you have a recruiter who's searching for new people to fill your made up positions (ex: \"Senior Scaling Architect\"), your life will be much easier if you use more standard titles.\n\nAlso, don't elevate titles too early. If you hire a normal customer success person, don't name them \"Head of Customer Success\".\n\n## 7. Be less stressed?\n\nYou can be a hell of a lot less stressed when you can just hire people to handle the tedious problems of business. It's not guaranteed to make you less stressed, though.\n\n![Does venture funding make you more or less stressed? @jordangal](https://i.imgur.com/NP5MLAv.jpg)\n\n![Does venture funding make you more or less stressed? @sdmattg](https://i.imgur.com/SymBGzQ.png)\n\n![Does venture funding make you more or less stressed? @Jus10McGill](https://i.imgur.com/RB71jxG.png)\n\n# So... what can you do?\n\nRob isn't saying you _should_ raise funding, but there are definitely things to learn from it.\n\nHere are some options:\n\n* continue bootstrapping\n* consider VC-Funding (gross)\n* \"Fundstrapping\": raise some money at the beginning, then never raise money again\n\nWhen fundstrapping, boostrap to $20-30k MRR, then raise a single Angel round. You'll get the best of both worlds.\n\n# tl;dr:\n\nFunding lets you:\n\n* Hire for specialization\n* Pay market salaries\n* Hire senior talent\n* Hire faster\n* Work with a recruiter\n* Not waste time to save a few $$\n* Use standard job titles\n* Be less stressed\n\n\"Fundstrap\" with a single round of funding to get the benefits.\n\n---\n\n# Questions\n\n**Did you have to answer to a board?**\n\nWe had enough luxury to hand pick who was on our board, and we got along really will with them. It could've been a shit show.\n\n**It sounds like a lot of your negative parts of funding are just things that happen at scale.**\n\nIt's exacerbated when you have funding. Basecamp has grown over 12 years; hiring ~4 people a year makes it much easier to establish culture. Moving faster with funding makes it a lot harder to establish culture.\n\n**Do you have advice on protecting culture?**\n\nYes - write things down, and hire people who are on board with your written vision.\n\n**Is there anything else you wish you could've afforded?**\n\nCustomer acquisition! Leadpages perfected the paid acquisition revenue model.\n\n**As a micropreneur, what's the advantage of fundstrapping over a bank loan?**\n\nIf you want to be a solopreneur, grow something up to $10k or $20k MRR and have an awesome lifestyle business. Rob did that for several years and eventually wanted something more.\n\nThe advantage over a bank loan is that it's lower risk - if the business fails, your personal credit isn't destroyed.\n\n**If I fundstrap, how much of my business do I need to give up?**\n\nFirst bootstrap to the $20-30k MRR mark so you have a $4-6M valuation, then sell 10% for ~$500k.\n\n**When do you pay it back?**\n\nEither when you get acquired or by paying dividends.\n",

Hopefully it's by a successful exit.\n\n![We are all going to leave our business someday. Hopefully it's by a successful exit.](https://i.imgur.com/bJRaTXW.png)\n\n## Thomas and FE International\n\nSince founding FE International in 2006, Thomas has done several hundred million dollars in deals. They invest loads of time with each business to increase the selling success rate (currently 94.1% for FE International, vs. ~20% in the industry).\n\nIn the last several months, Thomas has done several deals ranging from a few hundred thousand to a few hundred million.\n\nHere are the top lessons Thomas works with entrepreneurs on to sell their businesses.\n\n## Lesson 0: Get your ducks in a row\n\n![Write down all your processes and improve it with time](https://i.imgur.com/YDNPByF.png)\n\n## Lesson 1: Take Incremental and Measurable Risks\n\nWhen you do come to sell, you need to be in a position to prove any of your claims. If you claim your users doubled over a period, you need to show how you measured that.\n\nIf you want to test pricing, incrementally measure the success of testing pricing on a smaller group.\n\nCompanies that have been successfully sold take small, incremental risks. If you're not failing often, you're not trying hard enough. You should be continually testing experiments to see what works.\n\n> Companies that have been successfully sold take small, incremental risks.\n\n## Lesson 2: Make it sustainable\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rBoZtnI.png)\n\nKey mistakes when people are just starting out is to give away far too much value for not a lot of return. Don't sell lifetime subscriptions to your product to a cheap price. Don't give away annual plans at a massive discount.\n\n## Lesson 3: Focus on MRR growth and revenue churn\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EyVRhTY.png)\n\nIf you're ever going to sell, MRR growth is a big factor. Focus on sustainably growing MRR and decreasing revenue churn (customer churn doesn't matter as much).\n\nPeople paying you the most money are probably sending you the least number of complaints. Put things in place to keep those valuable customers happy and you can churn the lower value customers without affecting revenue churn.\n\n> A decision that raises revenue even though it churns vocal users is a good decision.\n\nWord of mouth has a CAC of zero, but it's hard to scale a business whose growth strategy is word of mouth.\n\nIgnore customer churn and focus on revenue churn. Focus more on the cohorts that are paying you the most.\n\nDon't fall victim to feature creep: focus on revenue.\n\n> Almost every SaaS business out there doesn't do pricing very well.\n\nBuild in expansion revenue. Don't have an unlimited plan, let users pay you more the more they use your platform.\n\n## Lesson 4: Sell at the right time\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WWaMDbZ.png)\n\nSell while it's still growing - don't wait until it's shrinking.\n\n## Questions on selling your business?\n\nAsk [@ThomasSmale](https://twitter.com/ThomasSmale)\n",

How to be friends forever with your customers\n\n# Val Geisler\n\n![Val Geisler's email campaign teardowns at valgeisler.com](https://i.imgur.com/FRAa6vk.jpg)\n\nVal Geisler is an email marketing conversion copywriter and strategist. She was the first marketing hire at ConvertKit, has worked with brands like AccessAlly, Pick, Beacon, Podia, Acuity Scheduling, and publishes email onboarding tear downs on her website at [valgeisler.com](https://www.valgeisler.com/category/tear-down/).\n\nIn this talk, Geisler explains her framework for writing successful email marketing campaigns through the sticky metaphor of hosting a dinner party. This technique can be applied to any type of campaign (onboarding, retention, etc.), and is the process Geisler goes through with her clients.\n\nIf you already send some emails to your list, but feel completely overwhelmed at the idea of segmenting and don't want to over-email, Geisler wrote this talk for you.\n\nVal Geisler can be contacted by email at heygirl@valgeisler.com.\n\n# Email Marketing Dinner Party Strategy\n\n![Plan your email campaign like you would plan a dinner party](https://i.imgur.com/vO2RoPw.png)\n\n![Email campaigns from Harvest, Calendly, DeepDyve, and Simple Invoice all send less than four emails over their entire 30 day trial periods. Effective onboarding campaigns are in constant contact with their customers through the trial period.](https://i.imgur.com/5Ed3Aov.png)\n\nEmail campaigns aren't \"set it and forget it\" - if you wrote your current email campaign years ago, it's time to revisit it. There's not a single correct way to structure your email marketing campaign, so use the Dinner Party Strategy as inspiration and **test everything**.\n\nWhen you revisit your email campaign, think of structuring it like a dinner party. When you host a dinner party, you welcome your guests, you serve them appetizers, a main course, side dishes, and dessert, and then you invite them back. Successful email campaigns have analogous parts.\n\nThough the Dinner Party Strategy can be applied to any type of email marketing campaign, we'll look specifically at an onboarding campaign.\n\nWhen hosting a real dinner party, you certainly wouldn't invite your guests over, hand them a plate of chicken, and leave them to fend for themselves. If you're only emailing your users a few times during their onboarding, however, that's effectively what you're doing. For best results, you want to be in constant contact with your customers during the trial period.\n\nAs long as you're being useful and personal, your users won't complain that you're over-emailing them.\n\n# 1. Welcome!\n\n![Drift.com's simple friendly welcome email.](https://i.imgur.com/S1LK0Ra.png)\n\nYou wouldn't greet someone at your house by turning your back to them, letting them fumble with their bags and shoes while trying to figure out where to put their coat, and you certainly wouldn't start shoving the main course in their face before they've even walked in the door.\n\nA dinner party requires a warm welcome, a friendly greeting, and lots of pacing. This email is the beginning of a beautiful relationship, so treat it like one.\n\nSay hi, make sure they feel welcome and comfortable, and get to know them. You can stuff their face with pot roast (your product) later.\n\nStart your onboarding campaign by just saying hi! It's a great friendly way to start your email onboarding party.\n\nIf your welcome email doesn't have a subject of \"Welcome to #{product_name}\", you'll stand out. Drift.com uses the subject line \"just saying hey\".\n\nVideos make your emails feel very personal, and don't need to be highly produced to be effective.\n\n# 2. Appetizers\n\n![An appetizer email from Better Proposals.](https://i.imgur.com/OymoXEF.png)\n\nNow that your guests are nice and cozy, you start bringing the value. In a dinner party value looks like appetizers, drinks, snacks. (Who doesn't love snacks?!)\n\nIn an onboarding sequence, value is giving your new customers what they need, not your product. Remember, your customers (should) have other touchpoints, like in-app messaging, so you can stick to delivering value and hit them with product features later.\n\nIf you must talk features, do it from a value-based perspective. What benefit will the customer get from using this feature? Make it about them and their goals.\n\nAppetizer emails add a small amount of value without shoving product features down a user's face.\n\n# Main Course: Your Product\n\n![A Main Course product email from PaySimple.](https://i.imgur.com/LK6uTSW.png)\n\nThis is the moment you've been waiting for - you get to talk about your product!\n\nAt your dinner party it's finally time to serve the main course and in your onboarding sequence that means this email is dedicated to the product.\n\nBut think about that dinner. Let's say you're serving pot roast as the main course. The conversation is going to be pretty boring if you focus on how long it took you to shop for that cut of beef, how much it cost you to buy, how your kids screamed in the car on the way home from the grocery store. Who. Cares.\n\nIf your conversation centers on what matters most to your guests (how the beef was grass-fed, you used a family recipe, it pairs well with the wine) your dinner party is going to build connection and engagement\n\n\n# Side Dishes!\n\nA main course alone doesn't make for a good dinner party.\n\nAnd product-focused emails alone (no matter how value-based) don't make for good onboarding.\n\nYour new customers are trying to learn a new skill, show off to their boss, feel confident and competent, and they feel pretty alone in doing all of this.\n\nBut you can change that! Delivering value again (aka teach what you know) is the best way to keep the connection going between those new customers and your brand. Teach them something and you'll be friends forever.\n\n![A long-form side dish email from CoSchedule detailing the free course they built for their new customers #large](https://i.imgur.com/rWRVXuX.jpg)\n\n# Dessert\n\n![A dessert email offering a free month by joining Dubsado's affiliate program.](https://i.imgur.com/6pJFbKM.png)\n\nThink it's time to talk product again?\nNot so fast.\nWell, at least not in the context of what's in it for them.\nAt this point in your dinner party/onboarding sequence things are\nstarting to wrap up. Free trials are ending, guests are going home.\nGet them to stick around a little longer with an enticing dessert!\n\n# Return Invite\n\n![A return invite from Monday.](https://i.imgur.com/qgXmJXx.png)\n\nThe dishes are dirty, bellies are full, new friends have been made, and dessert plates have been cleared.\n\nNow what?\n\nA good party host invites their friends back. They plan the next gathering (assuming everyone had a good time, of course). And you can do that in your onboarding too.\n\nWhen a trial ends sometimes that's just the beginning. You could offer to extend their trial, invite them to come back again, or get them to engage with you via email exchange about what worked and what didn't (there's gold in those replies, btw)\n\n# Extra Tips\n\nSpend time writing subject lines. Questions that use \"you\" and \"your\" work well (ex: \"How will you bring your company to the next level?\"). Try the [subject lint generator formula](https://kopywritingkourse.com/subject-line-generator-formula/) and [CoSchedule's headline analyzer](https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer) for ideas.\n\nPlaintext emails work well.\n\nAbove all else: be useful, get personal, and limit distractions\n",
