_This recap is bad. Check back in a few weeks and I'll have unpacked everything Taylor said._

First off: this isn't about buildinga massive business, it's about being able to spend time having dinner with your family.

Hendricksen owns, operates, and advises multiple 6-7 figure businesses. He has backend access to \$100M companies and their experts. The advice in this talk has been battle tested at scale and works across different types of businesses.

# 1. Truths & Mythunderstandings

<!-- World class experts bat 0.400. Don't expect a home run every time. -->

<!-- 1-2 Channels = \$100M -->

SaaS == eCommerce == Digital Products

## Machine Learning is Taking Over

Humans can look at hundreds of buyer signals, like age, gender, location, and keywords. Machines can look at over 300M: purchases, searches, videos, time, apps, buying habits, and more.

If you can't afford to profitably acquire a customer, you don't have a business - you have an opportunity. Business is about building a machine you can put \$1 in and get \$2 out.

## Organic SEO

Get 4x better pillar content by writing posts over 5,000 words with a table of contents and rich media.

Rich media means multiple content mediums (text, audio, and video). If your original content is audio or video, throw it into [Amazon Poly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) to get it transcribed and post the text content alongside.

Add as much schema markup as possible. [MarketMuse](https://www.marketmuse.com/)

## Ad Content

Structure your ad content like a normal conversation (PDF, dealing with objections).

Emojis, gifs, and low-budget shaky selfie videos work well because they feel more real.

## Paid | Facebook

Things working well for Facebook ads in 2019 are:

- Lookalike Audiences
- Campaign budget optimization (CBO)
- Video Ad retargeting: you can get video views for a few cents each.

## Paid | Google

Things working well for Google ads in 2019 are:

- Custom Intent & Affinity Audiences
- Similar to audiences (lookalike)
- YouTube TruView for Action
- GDN Smart Display Campaigns

# 2. 80/20 Marketing: Traffic, Conersions, and Maximizing customer value

Email conversion content-type opt-in, and the product itself.

As a developer you can forget you're not selling a piece of software. You're selling an outcome.

Instead of "scheduling software," you sell "never feel embarassed about missing a meeting again."

Give them exactly what they want
