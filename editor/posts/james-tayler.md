James has made $100k in bitcoin, and prevented a $100k loss in a sushi restaurant. Here's his framework.

Why are we afraid of failure? Because we evolved to be afraid of lions.

## James's Most Epic Failure

James had a stupid investment, but he didn't die!

Assume 100% of the downside risk goes to zero and only take bets you can handle walking away from

Consider the implications of your actions on a 20 year macro and reason through the 2nd & 3rd order effects

## The Emotional Foundation For Risk

1.  Assume 100% of the downside risk goes to zero and only take bets you can handle walking away from
2.  Consider the implications of your actions on a 20 year macro and reason through the 2nd & 3rd order effects
3.  Understand your ancient psychology is messing with you and it’s not actually life and death

## Learning Business

James taught himself business from TV, which helped him be cautious of a restaurant investment broker who didn't know the numbers.

Every bet has risk and reward.

* 9-5 job: DOWNSIDE = zero; UPSIDE = capped at salary+benefits
* Business: DOWNSIDE = capped at capital + opportunity cost; UPSIDE = all the money you could possibly make on that venture

## Expected value

The formula for expected value is:

```
(Total Upside * Probability) – Opportunity Cost = Expected Value
```

Simple case:

```
($1,000,000 * 25% chance) - $0 = +$250,000 Positive Expected Value
```

More realistic case:

```
($1,000,000 * 25% chance) - $100,000 = +$150,000 +EV
```

## Thought Experiment

What If you…

* Read a new book every week
* Talked to customers / potential customers every day
* Constantly shipped product
* Continuously met credible and connected people

…for 300 years?
