Wood automated the process of getting sponsorships for his podcasts on [devchat.tv](https://devchat.tv). He kept his average invoice at \$10k, and the average invoice was still 8 weeks long, but he raised his fill rate from 42% to 86%.

How? He reached out to more companies, which meant they scheduled more calls, which meant more sponsorships sold. Wood also set a schedule to follow up on renewals.

# How do you identify targets to put in the funnel?

Look for companies:

- that market to software developers
- spending money to reach software developers
- that employ people I know
- that are sponsors of other podcasts or conferences

Internet stalk marketing people by:

- Finding the company on LinkedIn
- Making LinkedIn list their employees
- Searching the employees for people with Marketing in their title
- Taking that name and use hunter.io to find their email address
- Adding the contact and information to Hubspot

Next, schedule a sales call! You can use meetings.hubspot.com.

# Automation

Once you build a process, you can automate it further by:

- Hire someone to do my prospecting for me. Have them handle renewals.
- This is how Iâ€™ve maintained the fill rate.
- Write a follow up sequence about how to sponsor podcasts
- Record videos and have someone else actually write the emails.
