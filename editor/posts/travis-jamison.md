# Hack 1: ~Less is More~ Audit Your Existing Content!

Removing underperforming content will frequently produce better results than adding new content. `Site health + improving topical relevance = winning.`

How? First, identify the pages to remove by asking for each page:

- Is page older than 6 months?
- Generate a meaningful level of traffic? (organic, social, etc)
- About a core topic of your business?
- Have thin content?
- Good Backlinks?

If a page has zero backlinks, no traffic, and isn't topically relevant, get rid of it!

If a page has good backlinks but no traffic, try consolidating posts with 301 redirects.

Traffic from social media or ads, but no ranking/backlinks?
a) No-index or
b) Optimize for rankings

For help - [Ahrefs blog & Traffic Think Tank have good references](https://ahrefs.com/blog/content-audit/).

# Hack #2: borrowing brand names

Competitors

Synergistic brands
a) Zapier

Brand vs Brand
a) Competitor vs Competitor vs Me
ex: Mailchimp vs Aweber vs Drip

# Hack #3: focus on buyer intent for your product

Transactional keywords are a tiny sliver of total inbound traffic, but make up the vast majority of purchases.

For example, Jamison had a product called "amazon rank tracker." Google volume for "amazon keyword rank tracker" was super small, but converted incredibly well.

~ 150 visitors/m
~ 30 subscribers/m from that page (crazy conversion rate) \*$50 avg = $1,500 MRR/m

# Hack #4: SEO in 2019  is more about "topics" and less about "keywords"

Backlink anchor-texts are less important

No Half-Assing Your Content - Cover the topic

More “complete” guides > Less one-off topics

Google eats structured shit all day long:

- Lists
- Table of contents
- Schema
- Tables

Ask and answer questions:

_Q: What is the best food for unicorns you may ask?_
_A: Well, the best food for unicorns is…_

TF\*IDF: Term Frequency  times  Inverse Document Frequency.

# Hack #5: How to get 548% more backlinks

How? Incentivise your prospects.

Offer to promote the post on social media . Offer to promote the post in your newsletter . Offer free products. Offer to pay “administrative fee” for their time  - Use dummy agency.
