## Bio

Former director of revenue, Exceptional Software (acquired by Rackspace for $10M). Currently director of fomo.com.

## Fomo.com

Social proof app that boosts conversion rates (ex: "your friend just bought this thing!"). Used to be a shopify app ("notify") doing 18k MRR, then Justin and his brother bought it with seller financing (ask him about this!).

Justin saw a massive conversion boost (20%) by implementing Fomo on his other site, [Kettle and Fire](https://www.kettleandfire.com/).

## First 18 months to 4x

Here's what Justin did to grow Fomo 4x in 18 months.

### Day 1: Raise Prices

So many people still don't do this. They feel like they want to give their customers a good deal, and raising prices cheats their customers.

Justin raised the bottom tier from $14.99/month to $29/month, and added multiple tiers up to $199/month. Now he could capture the value of higher value customers.

After raising prices, they saw basically no difference in conversions. Raising the prices just got rid of "kicking the tires" bad customers.

### Day 2: Optimize the shopify listing

> What can we do to increase the likelihood that someone signs up?

Shamelessly ask for reviews! "If you like notify, could you take 30 seconds to help me grow my little business? If you have any feature ideas, let me know! We're adding features over the next few months"

This catapulted Fomo to the top of Shopify ratings with 50 new reviews. Shopify is also excited about sharing Fomo. Also [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/).

### Day 3: Churn

Started with churn of 1-19%. If their app got delisted, they'd be out of business in 5 months!

How'd they decrease churn? Lots of no-brainers: show your customers that by using your product, they make more money. Fomo did it with Mixpanel automatic emails.

They also initiated as many one-on-one emails as they could. Five days after signing up, customers get an email `Intro: ${customer_name} <> ${customer_support}` from the CEO.
