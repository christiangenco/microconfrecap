~64.35% of Brian's customers came from hearing me on a podcast: either [Bootstrapped Web](http://bootstrappedweb.com/) or [Productize Podcast](http://productizepodcast.com/).

With every project Brian starts, he asks "how can I sustain this after I stop working on it?"

> When I move onto whatever the next thing is, I want my businesses to sustain themselves.

For a podcast, Brian really only wants to be interviewing interesting people, not:

* finding interesting people to interview
* researching interesting people
* handling inviting people and scheduling
* audio editing and mixing
* writing show notes with links and transcriptions
* designing a featured image
* uploading and publishing in WordPress
* sending new episodes to my email list
* posting new episodes to my social media accounts
* emailing the guest their published episode
* report on listener stats and trends

This stuff needs to get done, so Brian set up a process to get them done automatically.

As an example, here's what that process looks like for finding interesting guests:

1.  Manually find the first few guests
2.  List places where interesting guests can be found (like other podcasts, communities, customers, etc.)
3.  Producer/editor suggests potential guests from those places in a gravity form with a brief (website, point of interest, other interviews)
4.  Brian approves or denies the suggestion with a reason why (so the process can be improved)
5.  Producer invites the guest
6.  Guest books on Brian's calendar

Audience Ops is starting up [a new service for podcasting](https://audienceops.com/podcasting/) that does this process for you.
