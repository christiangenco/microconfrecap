## Who The Hell is Adam Wathan

https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/989174075695120385

Adam started with a SaaS app that did just $3k in sales total. After that flopped, he was looking for another way to live on an online product.

The next thing he tried was launching an infoproduct - Refactoring to Collections (launched in May 2016)

In the first three days, it made $61k, so he quit his job!

His next product was [Test Driven Laravel](#), which made $116k in its first three days of launching.

# Info Products

## Why an info-product?

![Rob Walling hadoukens his Stair Step approach - a great model for starting with an info-product](https://i.imgur.com/IvrS4Iq.jpg)

Why info-products?

* One-time purchase products are way easier to sell
* They can be "done"; you don't have to maintain them forever
* You can put one together in 3 months of nights and weekends
* They put money in the bank fast then drop off, opposite of SaaS

> Selling subscription software is hard (courses are easy in comparison) @brennandunn

Being able to do this full time is awesome.

## Building an Audience

Why build an audience? It's really important that people trust you. Having a large audience can make up any other deficiency in your marketing plan. Having a large audience and no marketing strategy beats having a perfect marketing strategy and no audience.

> Having a large audience can make up any other deficiency in your marketing plan.

* You can't just throw up a landing page and expect people to sign up; people need to trust you and believe that you're the right person to help them.
* Audience size is an exponential multiplier for product success.
* No launch strategy + big audience > Perfect launch strategy and no audience.

Here's a strategy that works well for Adam.

> Help people where they already are @wesbos

https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/984500364245389312?lang=en

Adam does the same thing:

https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/829423543985307661?lang=en

[steveschoger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger) in Setember 2016 had 436 twitter followers. He was just doing typical social media updates

![](https://i.imgur.com/c9CAktU.jpg)

After posting more helpful tweets and helping people where they are, he's jumped to over 20k followers:

https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/981606881255976961

## Picking the Right Idea

### Step 1: Have an idea

* What are you already putting out there that people seem excited about?
* What are you excited about that you think others will get excited about?
* What do people think you're better at than they are? What sorts of questions are people asking you? If people think you're better than them at something, that's an opportunity to teach.
* What have you learned outside your community/watering hole that you think your community would benefit from?
* What did you have to figure out yourself but was really helpful to learn? You could make it easier for other people.

> You could be the Christopher Columbus of programming knowledge.

### Step 2: Test it

Adam tests ideas with small tweets:

https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/956620857236959232

If it looks like things are working in a tweet format, he moves to a longer form (like high quality long-form comprehensive blog posts):

https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/976909385938059264

Start cataloging any good feedback you get about this test content, like replies on Twitter, blog post comments, etc. It'll be useful very soon!

### Step 3: Define the Product

* Plan small; it will end up bigger than you think
  * Short books are still books. People don't want to read a 500 page book on something if they can read something in 4 hours that gets the same result.
  * 3 hours is plenty for a video course
* Books are a lot easier to work on, especially if you only have short blocks of time
* Courses are easier to sell at a higher price but a lot harder to produce on nights and weekends

## Putting up a Landing Page

For [Advanced Vue Component Design landing page](https://adamwathan.me/advanced-vue-component-design/), Adam started with a clear headline on the value his users will get: "Learn how to design simpler, more flexible components that are both more powerful and easier to maintain."

![Advanced Vue Component Design landing page has a clear value headline and call to action](https://i.imgur.com/YVfPkj5.jpg)

Next, give them a **clear incentive to sign up**. Not just "sign up if you're interested" - give them a reason to give you their email address! Promise them some free content. In this example, "Sign up for free screencasts and a big discount when the course is released this May."

Next, give them some context to trust you: [Renderless Components in Vue.js](https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/) proves Adam is an expert.

User testimonials are a great way to get social proof.

![If PJ Trainor trusts Adam, you should too](https://i.imgur.com/HhvcBAi.png)

The more you can do to convince your audience that you're someone to be trusted, the better.

### Should I pre-sell?

> I never felt happier than the day I finished my content. It felt like a huge burden lifted from me.

Adam has experimented with pre-selling on his info-products.

ADVANTAGES:

* Best form of **product validation**. If someone gives you money before you've created it, that's great proof that they're actually interested.
* You'll **make more money**. You'll have more opportunity to promote it by telling people about updates without seeming spammy ("buy this! buy this! buy this!")
* More **motivation to finish**. If you already have people's money, you'll push through burnout. You don't want to not deliver on something people have already paid you for.
* Can **buy you the time to focus on the product**. If you have a successful pre-launch, you can afford to do less freelance work to buy more of your time.

DISADVANTAGES

* Selling **multiple tiers is trickier**. It's harder to get people to buy the more expensive packages if right now they all get the same thing.
* Can't easily **change scope**. Cutting scope is a great way to make your goal more attainable, but if you presell and promised too much you can end up in a situation where it takes you way longer to finish, which is a beat-down.
* Like **taking on debt**, can be extremely stressful. Mechanically, pre-orders make you more money. Psychologically, it can be really stressful.

> "Holy fuck I gotta finish this thing people are gonna be so fucking angry." - maybe don't presell

## BUILDING YOUR EMAIL LIST

### STEP #1: TELL YOUR AUDIENCE

Announce that you're going to announce your announcement before you announce it:

https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/978661856687484928

> Announce that you're going to announce your announcement before you announce it

You usually get your biggest spike in signups at launch. How can you sustain it?

### STEP #2 SHARE UPDATES

Keep your list engaged and excited about the product by sharing updates:

https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/988443466890854402

If you don't have anything free to send out, just send out a work update:

https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/987362810521792512

### STEP #3 REPURPOSE CONTENT

If you're working on this full time, it can be hard to also be generating content to hype it up.

Try just repurposing your main content into a massaged blog post:

![Repurpose content you already have](https://i.imgur.com/5YaplDi.png)

## Getting it Finished

### STRATEGY #1: MAKE PROMISES

Making promises to your audience can keep you on track:

https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/982749280849940480

### STRATEGY #2: EMAIL ON A SCHEDULE

For Adam's audience, emailing once a week is pretty good so they don't forget about what he's working on and stay excited. He's afraid to stop emailing people

### STRATEGY #3 REDUCE SCOPE

If you find you've been working on this for 6 months but there's no end in sight, but you _already have something substantial_, just move the finish line closer.

## FIGURING OUT PRICING

### TOPIC #1: TIERED PRICING

SINGLE TIER

* Can be fine if you can charge enough
* Often necessary if you're pre-selling
* Nice if you can't figure out a way to add additional tiers that actually feel valuable In general, prefer multiple tiers
* In general, prefer multiple tiers

![People were willing to pay the top tier, so Adam never made the cheaper tiers](https://i.imgur.com/VkV1wZj.png)

TWO TIERS

The first tier usually only exists to push people to the second tier.

* Usually a price anchoring strategy, first tier makes second tier look like better deal
* Second tier is usually the "real" product
* Prices are often close-ish, maybe 1x and 1.5x
* Works well with video courses where easy to cut content for budget version

![@wesbos's first tier only exists to price anchor to you to buy the second tier](https://i.imgur.com/8jjKhqg.jpg)

THREE TIERS

* Great for books if you can come up with the bonus content
* Makes it easier to evaluate as its own product instead of comparing to Amazon book prices Prices are usually 1x, ~2x, ~5x
* This will make you a lot more money from a book than just selling the book on its own

Refactoring to Collections has packages at $39, $79, and $179.

![Even though the top tier of Refactoring to Collections only sold 220 copies, it made the most money](https://i.imgur.com/XdTnSaI.png)

### TOPIC #2: LAUNCH DISCOUNTS

TIPS

* Discount it by enough to be appealing, at least 30%
* Use stepped discounts; lower discount on cheaper tiers and better discount on higher tiers
* Discount it by enough to be appealing, at least 30%
* Reverse engineer non-discounted price from your planned discounted price, it'll help you Charge More™.

## Nailing the Launch

This is actually the easy part of the whole thing.

### STEP #1: BUILD THE SALES PAGE

* Still include an email sign up that sends preview content for new traffic. A lot of people are tire-kickers, just be careful you don't go to jail and get fined $20M euros.
* Testimonials and social proof are important; use feedback from preview content to start

### STEP #2: ANNOUNCE THE LAUNCH DETAILS

TIPS

* Include all package and pricing details
* Complete TOC or content list
* Final free content preview if possible

### STEP #3 LAUNCH IT

The easiest and most fun part!

* Simple email: "It's available, all the info is here at the website."
* I like Tuesdays. I have no evidence but it seems at least as good as any other day. Morning EST works well for me

> I like Tuesdays. I have no evidence but it seems at least as good as any other day

If you've done all the stuff properly, you should be able to just sit back and watch the money roll in.

### STEP #4: LEVERAGE EARLY FEEDBACK

You're not done! You still have more emails to send. You'll start getting feedback, and you need to start cataloging it.

https://twitter.com/philwinkle/status/733273064201392128

Send an email to everyone that hasn't bought it yet with this early feedback and a bunch more people will buy it.

Don't be afraid of giving out free content! Adam gives out ~60% of the content for free.

### STEP #5: CLOSING THE LAUNCH

Don't specify a closing date in advance.

> Why did I do this? I had a firehose that was shooting money at me and I turned it off?!

I recommend not specifying a pre-defined launch window. Let people make their own assumptions, and if anyone asks say "within the next couple of weeks."

Turning off a money hose sucks; announce the launch end date when the initial excitement has died down and use the urgency to drum up another round of sales.

# Questions

**You had huge spikes at launch, but also a long tail. Did you re-prime the pump?**

Those charts are just for the first few days - there's not a huge tail.

In general, I send people free content over 2 weeks from the landing page email CTA. I send them an expiring offer to buy it at a discount (stolen from Brennan Dunn).
