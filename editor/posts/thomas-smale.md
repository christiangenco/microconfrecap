## Thomas and FE International

Since founding FE International in 2006, Thomas has done several hundred million dollars in deals. They invest loads of time with each business to increase the selling success rate (currently 94.1% for FE International, vs. ~20% in the industry).

Here are the top lessons Thomas works with entrepreneurs on to sell their businesses.

## Lesson 1: Take Incremental and Measurable Risks

You need to be in a position to prove any of your claims. If you claim your users doubled over a period, you need to show how you measured that.

If you want to test pricing, incrementally measure the success of testing pricing on a smaller group.

Companies that have been successfully sold take small, incremental risks. If you're not failing often, you're not trying hard enough. You should be continually testing experiments to see what works.

## Lesson 2: Create sustainable operational efficiencies

Systemizing each piece of your business makes your business more efficient.

## Lesson 3: Analyse churn and listen to your customers

Word of mouth has a CAC of zero, but it's hard to scale a business whose growth strategy is word of mouth.

Ignore customer churn and focus on revenue churn. Focus more on the cohorts that are paying you the most.

A decision that raises revenue even though it churns vocal users is a good decision. Don't fall victim to feature creep: focus on revenue.

> Almost every SaaS business out there doesn't do pricing very well.

Build in expansion revenue. Don't have an unlimited plan, let users pay you more the more they use your platform.

## Lesson 4: Sell at the right time

Sell while it's still growing - don't wait until it's shrinking.
