There are so many principles of improv and humor that can help you shape marketing copy, connect with your users, built loyalty, and increase retention.

> My parents have managed to miss all my shows :(

If your SaaS isn't using humor, you aren't getting the results you deserve. You could be connecting more genuinely with your users.

Funny copy can be _longer_ and _convert better_. There's a strong connection between humor and money.

_"Ok yeah but my software isn't funny"_ - is it less funny than [stormwater compliance software](https://www.mapistry.com/)?

## 1. WHY humor affects us

Why is humor sometimes uncomfortable? It **makes us vulnerable**. Past experiences of offending people make us wary, and we feel like work should be serious.

Humor has huge advantages though. It activates parts of the brain associated with happiness and fulfillment that make us more receptive.

Even when your campaign is delivering bad news (like prices )

### Humor topics

_What is a joke I don't understand teach me_ - you probably if you're German

Pick your humor topic by asking your users what they like (movies, books, standup comedians, dank memes, etc.)

![How do you know what your users will find funny? Literally ask them.](https://i.imgur.com/IaSyp1c.jpg)

Once you know what your users think is funny, humor topics are anything both you and your users think are funny.

### Humor Style

Generally, humor can be either **observational** or **self-deprecating**.

![Observational humor in SaaS](https://i.imgur.com/uIC8w5q.png)

Self-deprecating humor is making fun of yourself or your product. You're the butt of the joke, so the risk of offending is low.

## 2. WHERE to use humor to best effect

Don't use humor in your value proposition (the quick line or two of text explaining what it is you do and why your users should care). This could muddy your value proposition and lose your customer quickly.

If you're sending traffic to landing pages, it's okay to crack a joke because you know more about your users. Surprising humor can keep your user reading.

Humor also works very well in emails and in your app experience (ex: instead of just "date range", "date range be like" from FOMO has more personality).

## 3. HOW to punch up your copy line by line

There are three types of comedy punchups:

1.  Show your emotions
2.  Piss off your grammar teacher
3.  Lead the way

### 1. Show your emotions

Writing in ALL CAPS (sparingly, so you don't seem like an old person trying to use the internet) is a great way to show emotion in copy.

Comic book words - tangible action words - breath emotion into your copy

![ZAPPIN some action words your way](https://i.imgur.com/AJHG2EP.jpg)

Making asides is another great way to humanize your copy.

Gifs can be great, but use them sparingly. If they're too long, referencing jokes your users won't get, or irrelevent to their context they won't work well.

### 2. Piss Off Your Grammar Teacher (POYGT)

Using unconventional grammar can increase conversions:

- adsf
- Including a typo in your subject line (like "moar")
- using contractions and abbreviations (now "Hot is it going (fellow kids)", but "so I wanna know", "gonna", etc.)
- chop up your sentences

### 3. Lead the Way

Ask and answer questions to get right to what your user is thinking.

![Lead the way by anticipating your user's questions](https://i.imgur.com/nqa34fk.jpg)

You can also try trailing off with ellipsis...

...and including a call to action! "Upgrade my Bear!" is a great CTA, "take a look inside" isn't.

# Questions

**Hi, I'm in the funeral niche...**

!["Hi, I'm in the funeral niche..."](https://i.imgur.com/OXuMFuJ.gif)

**...does it really work across all industries?**

Results may vary. It's totally possible though. You know your target client: if they're cool with death, it could totally work.

**Do you know a type of humor that can work across age demographics?**

Start with research into what your audience thinks is funny! Now that you know misspellings don't work on older people but do on younger people, you can tailor your humor accordingly.

**Does B2B vs. B2C matter?**

B2C has gone whole-hog with humor. Would you rather have a president that can crack a joke about himself, or one that can't take a joke?

**How do you ask people what they think is funny?**

It's random and surprises people. Sandwich it between other user research. Ask two questions with data you really need to know, then reward them with a question about what they think is funny.

**We used to have a gif of Arnold lifting weights but it was cats instead of weights, and most people found it funny but some called us animal abusers. What do you do with those kind of reactions?**

![Apparently some people find this offensive](https://i.imgur.com/jxaAK9m.gif)

Ask who your ideal user is - what's the lifetime value of someone who likes the gif vs. those who don't? Focus on people who are worth it to you.

**How do we test what's offensive? Are there baby steps if you're in a sensitive, serious industry like public safety?**

Integrate humor slowly and cautiously. Test a version of _a_ joke in _one_ email.
