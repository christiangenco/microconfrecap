# Story Time

Justin started a showboard shop with two friends in 2003, which was a huge mistake.

![Justin's dream was to start his own snowboard shop](https://i.imgur.com/bExR2as.jpg)

![Justin's snowboard shop opened in 2003 and closed in 2005. At 25, he was $85k in debt](https://i.imgur.com/oW4F5AD.jpg)

He learned a few things.

## Lesson 1: Choosing the right customer is more important than what you sell.

![This guy's name is "Fauckler." Does it look like he has any money? Snowboarders are bad customers.](https://i.imgur.com/WUTvhcG.jpg)

## Lesson 2: starting small is almost always better than going big.

![The lessons you learn when you start small just get magnified when you go big.](https://i.imgur.com/HXu1ViU.jpg)

If Justin had started small, he would've known the Faucklers are bad customers, but with smaller stakes. He could've gotten out for cheaper when he realized he didn't like it.

> For an idea to get BIG, it needs to start small -@sivers

## Lesson 3: the way we start businesses is wrong.

The idea people have behind building businesses is that you:

1.  Have a good idea
2.  Launch it
3.  $$$

But this doesn't work! We we evolved it:

1.  Have a good idea
2.  Validate it
3.  Launch it
4.  $$$

Even product/market fit isn't enough, though. You need more than that.

> You need more than product/market fit. You need market/founder fit, product/market fit, and product/founder fit.

Is your audience a group of people that you want to serve every day for the rest of your life? Is this product a good fit for what you want? Does it match up with your values? Does it get you where you want to go?

# Product Validation Roadmap üó∫

Are you at Microconf to find a product idea? Are you trying to choosing a target market? Do you want to validate your product idea? Have you launched, but need more customers? Justin can help.

Here's Justin's step-by-step approach for:

* Identifying who you are, and what you want
* Choosing a market
* Discovering what they want
* Shipping a (small) initial solution

## Section 1: Know thyself

### Question 1: What's your motivation for wanting to build a product?

People call Justin for coaching all the time trying to get him to validate their idea. "I wanna do arbitrage for cryptocurrency!" - Justin isn't the target market! But he knows you need to figure out _why_ you want to do this.

_"I want to build a product so that I can \_ ."_

### Question 2: What do you value?

What [core values](https://jamesclear.com/core-values) do you have?

* Creativity
* Impact
* Integrity
* Adventure
* Family
* Wealth

Specifically, how wealthy would you like to be?

* Very wealthy ($1 million+)
* Higher than average ($300k / year)
* Financially secure ($150k / year)
* Basic needs ($50k - $100k / year)

## Section 2: choose your market

Who do you want to serve? Start with a group of people you want to help. A great business isn't about you, and your dream. It's about helping your customers achieve their dreams.

> A great business isn't about you, and your dream. It's about helping your customers achieve their dreams.

A few ideas for finding your market:

* How do you currently make a living?
* What kind of customers do you serve at work? (these people are already paying for your expertise)
* What communities do you belong to?
* What do you do better than anyone else?

![Ian Landsman's first customers were people he was already serving](https://i.imgur.com/bBR2vdd.jpg)

Factors to consider:

1.  How do they spend money?
2.  How big is the market?
3.  How easy are they to reach?

![BjoÃàrn Forsberg started by building shopify apps - a huge market that spends a lot of money](https://i.imgur.com/7cqMPfI.jpg)

Also consider how easy your audience is to reach.

![Adam Wathan's audience (PHP developers) is super easy to reach - they all hang out on twitter @adamwathan](https://i.imgur.com/cycSrnX.jpg)

## Section 3: customer research

What are the big pain points that already exist? What problems are simmering in your target market?

What do they search on Google? What kinds of questions are they asking every day?

Here are some tools to help you out:

* [Productvalidator.com](https://Productvalidator.com)
* [Answerthepublic.com](https://Answerthepublic.com)
* [Ahrefs.com](https://Ahrefs.com)

![ProductValidator.com helps you see your audience's pain points](https://i.imgur.com/jqIqCDr.png)

Also, do interviews! Phone, skype, or in-person.

![Justin got the founder of Balsamiq on a skype call just by asking](https://i.imgur.com/TBQCh0N.png)

Questions to ask in an interview (for B2B):

1.  What's your focus right now at work? What are you looking to improve?
2.  What's something you'd like to accomplish, but can't? What's holding you back?
3.  What was the last product, service, or tool you bought for work?
4.  What's your least favorite tool you have to use right now?
5.  What kinds of tasks are you currently doing in Excel?
6.  What product do you wish existed (but doesn't yet)?

What trends are you seeing in the community? Right now in the Microconf community, GDPR is a hot topic.

![GDPR hate is trendy in Microconf](https://i.imgur.com/b55BAEG.png)

Summarize your research

* What patterns emerged?
* What would say are the #1 and #2 things your market is struggling with?
* What would it mean for them if you solved that struggle? We're solving problems for real human beings!

## Section 4: your hypothesis

This group wants `${outcome}`, but struggle with `${struggle}`.
I can help them by removing these obstacles. Now, their life looks like this: `${better_life}`.

Podcasting example

Many tech businesses want `a branded podcast`, but struggle with `getting listeners`.
I can help them by:

* improving their show art + description
* getting them more ratings + reviews
* making their episodes easier to share

Now, their podcast `has more downloads, and their business has more brand awareness`.

## Section 5: start helping now

> "If you want to be useful, you can always start now, with only 1% of what you have in your grand vision. It‚Äôll be a humble prototype version of your grand vision, but you‚Äôll be in the game." @sivers

What's the smallest possible thing you could do that would validate hypothesis?

Podcasting example: a cunsolting service? Video tutorials on podcasting? A wordPress plugin? A simple utility?

> "Starting small puts 100% of your energy on actually solving real problems for real
> people." @sivers

## Section 6: evaluate results

What does initial validation look like?

* ‚úÖ Email addresses
* ‚úÖ ‚úÖ Preorders
* ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ Money (best)

> When you ask your audience ‚Äúwould you buy this‚Äù, many may say they will, but when it comes time to pay they don‚Äôt. Building a list is important, but it‚Äôs not a true indication of whether or not a product will sell. True validation comes from people actually paying you for that idea. @PatFlynn

Ask questions like "what was the last product you bought from work?"

Before Jason Cohen built WPEngine, he pitched it to people and asked if they would pay for it, then asked if they'd write him a check for their first month.

![Before Jason Cohen built WPEngine, he pitched it to people and asked if they would pay for it, then asked if they'd write him a check for their first month.](https://i.imgur.com/nu4V0G2.jpg)

Other trends to look for (especially in a client's slack):

* What is your target market investing in? (ex: ReWork podcast is a huge investment from basecamp)
* What's getting a lot of publicity right now?
* What are people struggling with?

## Summary of the process

Start with a small free offering. If that works, move to a small paid offering. If that works. build a simple product. If that works, put more features in and charge more.

### Transistor.fm case study

Here's how this has worked so far for Transistor.fm.

Justin started with some small free offerings of podcasts:

* ProductPeople.tv
* MegaMaker
* Build Your SaaS

In the process, he noticed some trends. 75% of people who bought Marketing for Devs, were podcast listeners, and made a huge effort to come talk to him because they felt like they'd known him for years (["If you make it to Vernon, BC, I'll buy you coffee"](https://justinjackson.ca/coffee/)).

![Transistor.fm stair stepper case study](https://i.imgur.com/6IWKaUe.png)

Justin also noticed a trend of tech businesses launching podcasts: StartUp by Gimlet, CodePen Radio, and others.

> "64.35% of my customers came from hearing me on a
> podcast." -Brian Casel

John works for Cards Against Humanity, so Cards Against Humanity was Transistor.fm's first client in starting [The Good News Podcast](http://www.thegoodnewspodcast.fm/).

Google is now transcribing and scraping Audio content - that's a huge positive sign in the trend of podcasting.

# Questions

**Who's your favorite American podcaster?**

[Adam Clark](http://avclark.com/), for sure.

**If you're already two months in with 6-10 customers, is it worth going back and building the audience?**

I think it is - there's so much pain if you don't figure out the personal questions of what you want, value, and how much money you want to make. If it keeps growing and doesn't match your values you'll end up in a lot of pain.

Don't get stuck making gambling machines in India.

**Is B2C SaaS always a bad idea?**

Ugh. Yes, but there's definitely people that make it work.

SaaS B2C businesses are things people desire: Netflix, Spotify, etc. It's hard to deliver that if you're a bootstrapper.

Prosumers are different - that sometimes works.

**Do you consider parameters for failures?**

I have much better parameters for success now. Ex: if I can't get 500 people on a mailing list, it's probably not going to work.
