# Dave Collins

![Dave Collins at the beginning of his SEO career](https://i.imgur.com/0tD4Jan.jpg)

Dave Collins is a regular on the Microconf stage. He's the founder of [SoftwarePromotions](https://www.softwarepromotions.com/) - an agency for improving website Search Engine Optimization (SEO) based in the UK. Collins has been working in the online software industry since 1997 and has an unhealthy obsession with data and trends.

He's "an awful rock climber, amateur photographer and a slave to his wonderful children."

# Search Engine Optimization isn't Dead

![There's a popular conception that SEO is dead.](https://i.imgur.com/X80QsXp.jpg)

<!-- !["places to visit in las vegas" Google search results show only one organic result on the first page, and several powered by organic results](https://i.imgur.com/ONPY0rS.jpg) -->

<!-- !["good restaurants in las vegas" shows mostly organic content](https://i.imgur.com/D5NVYhX.png) -->

!["where to buy euros" Google search results don't answer where to buy euros. Many obvious SEO opportunities still exist.](https://i.imgur.com/dJAOTo6.png)

Optimizing for search engine optimization (SEO) usually isn't a focus of online businesses. SEO work is boring, non-urgent, time consuming, unlikely to work, and could blow up in your face if you do it incorrectly.

Additionally, there's a popular conception that SEO is dead and doesn't work anymore.

The people saying SEO is dead are wrong, and likely optimizing incorrectly. If you completely ignore SEO, you have a risk of destroying your business.

In this talk, Collins guarantees ("kind of") to present a method of SEO that's easy, quick, effective, and won't blow up in your face.

He'll be covering some fundamentals of SEO, so you may still find it boring.

<!-- # SEO History and Fundamentals -->

<!-- the web used to be just text; google has become a verb. kids don't know they're using google -->

<!-- People like to point to ads on google search results and say search results are all about paid ads, but most google real estate is actually there for organic results. -->

# Testing Google's Intelligence

![Google image searching "black and white jack russell smiling next to a baby" returns only two valid results.](https://i.imgur.com/zaJihRF.jpg)

!["Visually similar" images to Dave Collins' profile picture are actually just matching page metadata.](https://i.imgur.com/OOPCNFT.jpg)

Let's test Google's ability to return valid search results.

TODO: why?

Searching for ["dog"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=dog), ["jack russell"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=jack+russell), and even ["jack russell smiling"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=jack+russell+smiling) yield excellent and accurate results.

Searching for any more specific queries quickly degrades the quality of results, though. ["black and white jack russell smiling"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=black+and+white+jack+russell+smiling) confuses Google: are you looking for black and white _pictures_, or black and white _jack russells_? Several of the results aren't black and white _or_ jack russells.

One step of specificity beyond that, and we've stepped outside of the sphere of Google's expertise. ["black and white jack russell smiling next to a baby"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=black+and+white+jack+russell+smiling+next+to+a+baby) has _maybe_ one relevant result on the first page. Once you've broken through the barrier of Google's ability, they don't know what they're doing, and they need help.

Similarly, reverse google image searching for a photo of Dave Collins returns several results that aren't at all visually similar, but are on pages that match "Dave Collins" in the metadata. Google isn't yet capable of magic - their results are still based primarily on text.

The fore fundamentals of SEO haven't changed at all in the last 20 years. Google needs our help - it's a partnership.

# SEO Action Plan

## Task 1: Low Hanging Fruit

How will google feel about bland meaningless copy, like "websites are becoming more and more common every day"? Bleh.

Here's the low hanging fruit.

> "Low hanging fruit," as you Americans like to say. Low hanging fruit? Low hanging fruit.

[Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) has four important parts you should be checking on a regular basis:

1.  Crawl Errors: anything google finds that causes a problem, like a 404. This is bad for google and you.
2.  HTML improvements: massively underestimated. Highlighted in [Google's search engine optimization starter guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en)
3.  Index Status: select all the boxes and make sure everything makes sense.
4.  Security issues: should always read "we haven't detected any security issues with your site's content". If not, stop everything and fix it.

## Task 2: Keywords

1.  How would your friend describe your page?
2.  Run these phrases through google - would your page make sense in this context?
3.  Use your imagination!

If you were looking for microconf, would you search for "conference for startups", "entrepreneurial conference", or "entrepreneur conference"?

Turns out "entrepreneurial conference" has the highest search volume!

Here's another example:

- seo service (1x)
- **seo services (6x)**
- seo training
- seo is dead

You have to use the tools, don't just guess what you think the most popular keywords are.

> People click on more compelling titles

## Task 3: More compelling content

If you have more than 10-15 pages of content, you don't need to write new content purely for SEO. It's more about making better use of what you have.

TODO: see low hanging fruit in spreadsheet?

What do people also ask? Reflect these ideas back at google!

![What do people also ask? Reflect these ideas back at google!](https://i.imgur.com/foA2Lms.png)

See the world as google sees it. You can also use tools like [ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/).

Get into the minds of the people searching. Look at the pain points, ideas, and themes of people searching for your stuff.

## Task 4: Use the Right Tools Correctly

- [Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/#?modal_active=none): useless from an SEO perspective because they round up all the figures. It's misleading.
- [Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console): more data than most paid SEO tools (this is free)
- [ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/): 7-day trial for \$7
- [Screamingfrog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/): desktop based software for scraping websites
- [Sitebulb](https://sitebulb.com/):
- [urlprofiler](https://urlprofiler.com/)

These tools wont' do the work for you, though

## Task 5: Feed the mobile index

Google is moving to mobile-first indexing. Your index will be based on the mobile version of your website.

[Rolling out mobile-first indexing](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/03/rolling-out-mobile-first-indexing.html) has quadrouple speak, but basically says Google will care a lot more about mobile indexes.

Responsive is not mobile-friendly. Check if your site is actually mobile friendly with Google's [Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)

## Bonus Tip

> Golden Rule: Put humans before spiders. Always

If you click on a website and get a page with a bunch of SEO nonsense, you're going to bounce, which is a super strong indicator your site sucks.

## 7 Rules of SEO

1.  Don't talk about SEO
2.  Fix the machine: don't just look good, work well
3.  Invest time in keywords
4.  A different approach to content
5.  Use the right tools
6.  Embrace mobile first ([check your website](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)). If you pass, Dave will let you buy him a drink.
7.  Humans before spiders.

Every once in a while, one of these seeds will fall in the right place and build something amazing.

# Questions

**When google gets a 404 on one of your page, how do you tell Google it's gone? A redirect?**

_Redirect removed URLs to the closest fit existing page._

**?**

_Use a NOINDEX in `robots.txt` to block that URL._

**You said to look in the search console and look for keywords with high impressions and low clicks. Why?**

_Those pages are probably showing up in search results, but not being clicked on. Those pages represent the best opportunity for optimization._
