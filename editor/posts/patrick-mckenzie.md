Patrick ran a several SaaS companies, and most recently started working at Stripe.

> Microconf lets us lead the life we want to live. We can be more present for our families and our communities. It's not _how_ you do it, it's _why_ you do it.

Don't get caught up in the silicon valley mentality. What are you going to do over the next 40 years?

## Decision making over the long haul:

* make more small bets. Very little of what you do in business are "trapdoor" (irreversable) decisions.
* decide quickly on reversible things that don't matter in the long run. Don't agonize about if you've hit perfection, just get it out the door.
* do things which still matter in 40 years. You have a sharply limited amount of time as an entrepreneur - do things that will matter years from now. Write about topics that will still matter in 20 years.

> Don't agonize about hitting perfection, just get it out the door.

## Grinding, duh

You don't need the long term perfect grand strategy, or being an expert, or know what you're doing: you need to go out there every day doing repetitive things that generate small amounts of value, and you need to do it a lot over a long amount of time.

> You need to go out there every day doing repetitive things that generate small amounts of value, and you need to do it a lot over a long amount of time.

## What should I build?

"What should I build" is the wrong question to ask first. Ask instead "who should I serve?"

What communities do you feel a calling towards? This is going to be a part of your life for the next several years, so the audience you pick will have a huge impact on your quality of life.

> "Are you going to bounce up every morning with enthusiasm at talking to dental offices?" - "oh god no!"

Pick people...

* ...who you're energized in talking to
* ...whose problems are tractable (ie: not "fight global poverty!")
* ...with money (serve people who can afford to pay for solutions)

Patrick bounces with enthusiasm talking to Microconf people! He had a business talking to teachers for 6 years and got really tired talking to them. Find the people you don't get tired talking to.

> Find the people you don't get tired talking to.

If you have charitable impulses, it's much easier to be charitable with a healthy business behind you.

We have this image of striving for a business that's all put together. Focus instead on adding a little bit to a puzzle (not a perfect analogy, since there's no end state in business like there is in puzzles).

Every day, if you've added a piece to your business that wasn't there yesterday and will still be there in years, that's a great metric for success

## Talk to people

It's never a bad time to talk to a customer or prospect. If you're capable of sending out cold emails, go for it.

## Platform before product

Build a marketing platform to cater to an audience first.

Build at least:

* 3 friendcatchers: don't learn to cook because you want to eat food, learn to cook because it's a great excuse to have people over. Build something that solves problems for people and you'll never lack people to talk to who have problems.
* 5 emails: (we'll talk about this later)
* ~45 days of grinding: you don't need a grand strategy or a fancy process, just talk/email/tweet to people every day

### The ideal friendcatcher

TODO: ven diagram

The ideal friendcatcher solves a problem that is resonant, tractable, and underserved.

How? Pay attention to pain people have. Javascript developers feel visceral pain at the phrase "build pipeline" - write about that!

Great forms of friendcatchers:

* stick-a-fork-in-it-and-it-is-done guide to one broadly applicable, tightly scoped problem: People come to it for years.
* calculator which replaces an excel spreadsheet: This is unreasonably effective because most people in the world can't program even at the level of silly excel spreadsheet. There's no level too trivial! A/B testing statistical significance is hard for normal people.
* definitive curated list of resources: listicles! plant a flag on the internet of a definitive list of everything great and outstanding in this field. Josh Kaufman has the definitive list of business books.
* cheatsheet: Amy Hoy made the Ruby on Rails Cheatsheet that turned her into a celebrity in the Rails community

> You can be the person that people are afraid to talk to

## Email Literally Everyone

Companies can't do lots of things at scale that you can. When you have ~100 people on your email list that want to hear from you, you have a huge advantage: you can email every single new subscriber individually. Be unreasonably interested in the topic and them. Do it every day until you get sick of it.

### Everything about email courses in one slide

* Make a promise with every subject line and keep it. That's the one copywriting trick you need to know if you know no others.
* 75% education; 25% sales. You need both. **Ask for the freaking sale at some point**
* Frontload delivery. 3x in the first week is fine, then back off a little bit.
* After the end of the course, email 1x every 2-4 weeks.

There's a world of people - find the people that love hearing from you, and establish the expectation that you'll be sending them more things they like.

### Checkpoints

* 10 great conversations (25 for SaaS)
* 500 emails
* 10 commits to buy (in SaaS) or you'll have a super hard time selling it.

You're going to be talking to customers for the rest of your life. You're not in the "doing cool stuff with your business phase" until you've had 10 great conversations (25 for SaaS).

Why? It's easy to go in the code cave for a few weeks or months.

Don't start the fun expressive work until you've talked to people.

Don't worry about any kind of marketing automation until you have at least 500 people on your list.

## Objective external indicia of progress

Patrick organizes his week like a dinner plate: one main course (50% of work), two side dishes, and everything else is a dessert that probably won't get done. One side dish should always be talking to customers.

For every piece of work you do (except talking to customers), you should have some indica of progress that's published.

## Build the actual thing

Building an awesome thing doesn't mean building the _best_ thing. It doesn't have to be a work of outstanding genius that will be studied 200 years from now.

The bar for businesses in the economy is _just_ above getting sued. It's disconcerting.

### Abuse your advantages

* "This is what I do" is an amazing sales message. Even if you just spend 60 days on something, you'll probably quickly become the world's leading expert in that thing. How many people are studying javascript pipelines? Saying "This is what I do" builds a lot of trust with customers. You can be the person that's _unreasonably_ good at the details (like Patrick's loan officer talking to every underwriter for 2 hours)
* Be _irrationally_ responsive to customers, especially early
* Most fast and _make things_. Most businesses don't have a development team capable of making _anything_, or a marketing team capable of _selling anything_. Check the microconf archives for more on this.

## Charge more

Charging more will get you more money, get you better customers, and attract people who you want to attract.

How much more? Whatever your number is right now, raise it.

TODO: reasonable floors, but not ceilings slide

Charge at tiers to segment out customers getting outstanding value from you.

## Stripe Atlas

Stripe Atlas helps companies get up and running. They can help create a C-Corp, S-Corp, business bank account, and community of business people to help you through problems.

Stripe giving you a business is like giving you a puppy - a year from now your business will be wagging its tale needing compliance and walks.

## Business advice

### Immediately

* get a new credit card: put every business expense on the credit card and it makes accounting a lot easier
* business gmail/google apps account (ex: `accounts@${domain}`, `receipts@${domain}`)
* use a password manager (OnePass, etc.)

### Medium term

* get an accountant
* find a peer group to talk shop with and meet regularly
* derisk your family life
  * retirement savings (talk to John Knox)
  * insurance (term life and long-term disability)
  * go to the gym like it is your job

# Questions

**Blog posts?**

Ahh yes! My blog has ~3M words on it. It was a mistake.

Don't make one of your life commitments keeping it up to date. A dead blog is worse than no blog at all.

Instead of a blog, post articles on your website that are definite evergreen guides.

**How did you become such a good storyteller?**

I'm the storyteller of my Irish Catholic family's generation. It seems to work for me for business, so I lean into it.

I don't have a great guide other than grinding at it. Tell more stories!

Try adopting narrative structure like [the hero's journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey).

**Do you hate B2C?**

I don't have an emotional hatred of B2C - I don't hate anyone anywhere. Hating people is a commitment of emotional energy in the future, and I'd rather commit to positive things.

Google has a war chest of a hundred billion dollars. You can't beat them at the B2C game.

If you have to, pick a demographic that has some money to pay and is super emotionally invested. Most consumers are pathologically bad at spending money on things. Prosumers like skaters who spend $800 on skates or [the guy who sold gaming tables](#) are better.

**How do you split time spent talking to customers vs. building?**

It depends on where you are in the cycle. I do 50/25/25 to tactical marketing/talking to customers/product.

If I didn't have a laser focus of what the product is, I'd spend the 50 on talking to people. Do it first thing in the morning so you can do the trivial, easy, fun stuff of building stuff.

**My favorite talk is your [Hello Ladies talk from Business of software](https://vimeo.com/96701548). How do you build things for people who aren't you?**

Even software for software developers is a huge market opportunity - if you're building software for people similar to you, it's probably still a good market.

Some markets can't pay, so don't serve a market like that. A market like "women in tech positions" is a great underserved market.
