**What's the most important thing you think attendees should do?**

_Ship something, and make it a habit to ship something every day._

**What mistakes do people make in the early days?**

_I think it's important to be okay going off the beaten path and go against common wisdom._

**What was your first business?**

_I launched a bunch of things that failed over five years, back when [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/) was the only person blogging about this. Starting with failure doesn't predict a future of failure. My first real business was [DotNetInvoice](http://www.dotnetinvoice.com/)._

**Which comic book do you buy the most?**

_One of my first businesses in high school was selling comic books. After I sold Drip, I had enough money to buy fun investments like Bitcoin and first edition comic books. [Spiderman #250](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Amazing_Spider-Man_Vol_1_250) is one of my favorites._

**Did you know after Drip what would be next for you?**

_I didn't - I wanted to take time off and had no idea what was next. I took six weeks off before I started thinking about [Tinyseed](https://tinyseed.com)._

**Does Tinyseed feel as stressful as Drip did in the early days?**

_It's way less stressful and quicker to build. I'm chasing the next challenge. You don't want to do the same thing - building a SaaS - multiple times. It gets boring._

**What's your [zone of genius](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briannawiest/2018/09/26/how-to-get-into-the-zone-of-genius-and-unlock-your-highest-potential/#6513497e5672)?**

_Trend spotting?_

_It might be just showing up for a long time. [430 podcast episodes](https://robwalling.com/), [18 conferences](https://microconf.com), the slog of Drip, etc._

**What's your criteria for TinySeed?**

_The founder is most important, then the traction of the product, and then the product itself._

_There are stereotypically successful founders that grind it out, others that are very quiet and show up every day, and others that are experts in specific areas._

**How do you fight the cognitive bias of finding people like you?**

_I don't think I'm the best founder, so I'm actually looking for people different from me._

**What do you think kept you from reaching success faster?**

_Fear. I was too scared to send cold emails, introduce myself at conferences, or speak on stage._

# Overrated Underrated

- chat bots: _short term overrated, long term underrated, similar to cryptocurrency_
- las vegas: _overrated. Hopefully next year it won't be in vegas! We do it here for cost reasons. It would be about \$200 more expensive per ticket._
- paid ads: _underrated. Not enough people take advantage of paid ads. Once you get that engine going it's super cool._
- twitter: _overrated. I've wanted to quit for 3 years but keep getting pulled back. There's no nuance for an actual conversation._
- batman: _underrated. Lego Batman is super cool._
