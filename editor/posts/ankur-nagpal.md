SaaS is supposed to be super exciting:

But in practice it was really boring for Teachable:

Here's how they did it over four years:

It took 64 people to get there.

# How Teachable architected growth on the backend

The growth model Teachable followed was:

* Growth was the priority.
* How can we leave as little to chance as possible?
* Let's take advantage of being small enough that we can strong-arm growth by doing things that do not scale.

They waned to account for where every dollar was coming from.

Here's how it played out in August 2015:

* end of July 2015 MRR: $25k
* Desire month-on-month growth rate: 30%

`Math math math`, they needed $10,843 to hit 30% growth. Where does that come from?

If they _did nothing_, expected MRR would be $8k.

"Revenue to be found" is therefore `$10,843 - $8,000 = $2,843`.

By the end, they "had to find" like a hundred thousand dollars, which was unfeasable. Early on, this number was a necessity that drove all marketing strategies. The number is also small enough to actually hit, and much better than just flying blind.

By targeting such a high number, they had to drive tactics that would have a shot in hell to hit the numbers.

## Growth Strategies at every growth stage

To find an exrtra **$500-$1k**/month, the strategy could be 1-1 direct sales based on personally sent cold e-mails.

To find an extra **$1k-3k**, the revenue could be found by 1-many sales to our audience by hosting a big webinar every month.

The next level up in growth, **$3k-$5k**, could be found by hosting a weekly reoccurring webinar every Thursday driving $1k in new MRR / week.

A strategy to finding an extra **$5k-$10k**/month could be layering on joint venture webinars with influencers in the space every week with target of $1k in MRR / partner.

> At every stage, the necessity of having to discover this revenue was the fuel behind all of our big growth innovations.

## Dismal Failures and Successful Strategies

**Idea 1**: Pitch customers with a predesigned website with their content refactored and uploaded from other sites to impress them upfront.

That failed because Seth Goden's people complained about piracy :(

**Idea 2**: A bot that tried to find e-mail addresses for everyone on Udemy and initiate a cold email from my personal Gmail telling them to use us instead.

That failed because the first person it "found" was the founder of Udemy :/

**Idea 3**: Instead of inviting partners to our audience one at a time, why not aggregate all of them and have them all promote the same bigger event they all contribute to - aka "the summit"?

Oh hey that worked! $25k in new MRR from the first event, and eventually up to $50k in new MRR from repeating those events. This was one of the big pivot points that made Teachable work.

**Idea 4**: Change the price of our Basic plan from $29 -> $39 since we added a bunch of functionality to it. We experimented with letting existing users claim it at the old price for a week before the change went into effect.

Oh hey that worked too! Usually in a SaaS, your LTVs will slowly go up over time with a price raise. By letting people get grandfathered into the old price, it drove $20k in new MRR for the duration of the campaign immediately.

> The necessity of "finding revenue" lead to the discovery of some of our best growth strategies.

Being driven by revenue goals helped sanity check projects that sounded great but wouldn't have driven growth.

Pulling this crazy growth out of nowhere month after month for 24 months had several secondary benefits:

* Built momentum and morale internally - everyone wants to work on a “winning team”
* Helped us raise capital at terms we wanted because of “traction”
* Growth begets growth - the bigger you get, the more your "mini-brand" grows
