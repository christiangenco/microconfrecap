Parallel entrepreneurship has a negative stigma, but there are a lot of people in this room that do it successfully.

There are also several public examples of superhuman parallel entrepreneurs:

* Jack Dorsey (Twitter and Square)
* Marcia Kilgore (Bliss, Soap & Glory, FitFlop, Soaper Duper, Beauty Pie)
* Elon Musk (freakin' everything)

> Why should investors get to invest in parallel startups and entrepreneurs only get to work on one?

## Reasons to be a parallel entrepreneur (from surveys)

* Pursuing a passion
* diversifying and de-risking
* developing a new skill
* being more productive
* exploring a new career

Most parallel entrepreneurs have backgrounds in writing or finance, not programming. They're able to switch between different projects by being very regimented and being creative about their resources.

Fun fact: most parallel entrepreneurs structure their businesses as LLCs.
