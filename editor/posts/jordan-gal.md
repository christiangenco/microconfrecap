# Content Marketing + Paid Advertising

Here's CartHook's campaign from January to March of this year.

CartHook has been slow in adopting content marketing. Paid advertising, contrastingly, has a clear ROI.

So what'd they do? **Content Marketing + Paid Advertising**

They took free content, retargeted their audience, and then offered a free trial.

1.  Get attention: get some mindshare
2.  Establish credibility: talk about your insight into the market
3.  Your product: in the context of market trends, you've earned the ability to talk about your own product
4.  Build audience
5.  Make offer

In practice:

1.  Get Attention: CartHook wrote and facebook promoted a "[$100-Million Dollars Lighting the Way (A Look Back at 2017)](https://blog.carthook.com/100-million-dollars-lighting-way-look-back-2017/)" blog post.
2.  Establish credibility: "[eCommerce Sales Funnels: A New Trend for Big Growth](https://blog.carthook.com/ecommerce-sales-funnels-a-new-trend-for-big-growth/)"
3.  "[Future Trends: What you Need to Know to Succeed in eCommerce in 2018 and Beyond](https://blog.carthook.com/future-trends-succeed-ecommerce/)"
4.  Product focus: "[How (and Why) to Optimize your eCommerce Checkout Experience](https://blog.carthook.com/optimize-ecommerce-checkout/)"
5.  Killer feature: "[The Art of Upsells (Boost Your Order Value While Building Trust)](https://blog.carthook.com/art-of-upsells/)"
6.  Repurpose to eBook: [The Advanced Guide to Ecommerce Funnels](#)

## Results

Each post was promoted for 7 days ($4k in ads). Got 127 retargeted free trials, which cost $32/signup.

These signups converted at 30%, which are paying $200/month.

**$4k spent to get $136k ARR!**

## What's next? MOAR

360 registrations on a partner'd [webinar showing a huge success story](https://carthook.com/webinars/how-to-sell-more-with-carthook) ($1M -> $2M/year in sales) translated into **$212k in new ARR for $4k spent**.

## How can you do it for your company?

Write and promote: an attention post, a market trend post (what's your unique insight into the market?), write a product post (what does your product...), a killer feature post (what is your differentiating feature that people need in order to succeed?). Then repurpose the content and host a webinar showing real results from someone using your product (promoting and retargeting this too).

# Questions

**How much time did you spend on this? How will you repurpose this campaign in the future - what's the 5-year strategy?**

It caught us off guard how well it worked - we're not sure. Unless we really nail the next idea it probably won't work as well.

**Is retargeting just within facebook?**

Yes. We also tried retargeting within Google but it didn't work as well.

**Why did you promote the pieces serially instead of in parallel?**

To capture and build up maximum attention, though we might not do it like this in the future.

**Are there other channels over email that are on your radar?**

Partner webinars.
