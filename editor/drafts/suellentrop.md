# tl;dr

When marketing a product, it's common for founders to focus on the product itself. "Look at our cool features! We help you do XYZ activity, but better!" This is a recipe for getting lost in the noise, and for losing to competitors with deeper pockets.

After this talk, you'll walk away with:

– An understanding of the "jobs to be done" theory
– An understanding of how JTBD helps companies create effective positioning
– A proven, step-by-step process for uncovering your customer's ultimate motivation ("job to be done")
