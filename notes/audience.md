## Takeaways

### Content marketing:

* **refining of my marketing pitch**. I was previously talking way too technically and it is too difficult to sell security. People need to immediately understand the actual impact to their company
* content (**copy, seo and content for marketing** like podcast and blogs) matters
* I need to try getting to the EU version (of microconf) as a goal
* I found the advice on **content development** to be particularly helpful
* **help people where they are** (specifically, try tweeting valuable code screenshots as a way of growing my twitter following), PAY ATTENTION to the response from blog articles, videos, tweets - and act on that info by creating similar content. Too often I look at traffic spikes, likes, and good comments as "oh yay, someone liked my thing!" and then I forget about it. Catalog good feedback from everywhere (twitter, email, ...) in one place to use later.
* being more creating in acquiring leads/customers. we've concentrated our efforts on events and referrals from old clients. Now we want to experiment on **content marketing and cold emails** for the moment.
* **When Adam Wathan talked about using Twitter to build an audience**. I have been off Twitter for a few years and struggling with self-promotion, and that tiny tidbit Adam offered gave me a whole new focus for the next few months.

### Talk to customers:

* **Interview our customers** to understand how they view us. We have a survey going out today
* **talking to potential customers** via where they are likely to be: Linkedin and asking for feedback on the problems they are running into. Grind, measure, adjust, repeat.
* **engaging your audience doesn't have to be spammy**. You can use humor and reach out to people, they will be happy you took the time. I rushed home and added an email confirmation for when people upload with an offer code, so they could use the site themselves someday. Not high pressure, just a friendly "thanks for contributing, here's a coupon"
* focusing on the audience. **Audience first!** I think the surprising take away I had was that I want to do more in the founder community (hence the reflections series)
* **marketing before building**
* getting to **know the audience and product validation**.
* I'm not doing nearly enough **customer outreach**, and that I really need a mid-tier info product on my stairway. Right now I've got "free" and "pretty expensive"
* I have an audience of 25K and have been **actively scheduling google hangouts with people** this week. I need to just always be doing that.
* I need to be more **audience/customer-centric** than product-centric. Building an audience is the #1 thing I'm missing currently.

* customer success is really just sales in a different uniform, some different demo strategies, **strong-arm growth**
* **Growth is a big deal** and relying just on organic is not enough, not by a long-shot. Even as my high-school's top math student I failed to grasp the significance of compound interest (I never bought a house) - growth is hard work but the returns are there. Garret Dimon's talk was a standout. It was very moving and personal and he also managed to draw brilliant parallels between his personal struggles and business struggles. I can totally relate to the allegory of those lessons for my business life. **Every talk had massive value. There were no "dud" talks**. Growth means a lot to me now because I launch in 4 days and I'm 51, I don't have 10 years to grow my things before I get started on adulting.

* think less about the product and think more about **business part** - customers, finances, marketing, branding, positioning etc.
* how to structure my SaaS trial (tie payment to a key feature rather than time)
* I really liked Mocja's FB tips: **facebook ads** mistakes
* definitely that we need to start going more **integration marketing**. It may start off with a Zapier integration and then progress from there.
* I need to build a **referral program** into my product, and I need to couple it with cash incentives
* where to take my business and finding the right fit for your audience, product, and you
* do big things systematically
* rising above the trees to be able to think about my business at 20,000 feet.
* **customer needs (B2C) are totally different from businesses needs (B2B)**. They're all about desire and that's a whole different ballgame.
* from a mastermind group dinner: that my product is releasable even if its sucks, because I can just market it more narrow
* **How they set sales metrics up and executed them**. I was kind of disappointed that **design wasn't touched upon**. One speaker mentioned they had a noticable revenue increase after optimizing their checkout page and I feel that topic should be discussed more. We always talk about sales funnels but not the design of the product or service. I think that's important too.
* I need to be **even more focused on growth as a thing in itself** not just "if you build it they will come"
* **increase LTV and decrease customer + revenue churn**
* **simply getting remotivated**
* the importance of incremental changes
* very tactical - I need to **increase scarcity in my sales email** in my mini-course-funnel to sell more. High-level stuff, such as the importance of founder/market-fit which I think was a great way of framing something I thought about but being unable to articulate as clearly.
* https://hunter.io/ lets you find email addresses of any professional
* figure out what my next big product is going to be

## Use

### Use it as a searchable reference:

* **reference** of sorts to look back on topics that I don't know very well so that I can **remind myself of the key points that I learned about them**.
* **reference and go back to it when I'm looking into specific topics**. I've gone through all the past MicroConf videos that are available online twice now. There's definitely value in the repetition and I'll probably do something like that with your recap too.
* **reference**
* keep the digital copy handy as a **reference** as I begin to implement some of the great ideas and tactics I learned about at MicroConf this year. I'm also looking forward to **reading the recaps from the growth side** of the conference, which I have no doubt will be interesting and informational even if my business isn't quite at that stage yet.
* I plan to use the recap book as a **reference - and as a way of getting inspiration**. The more info, the better :)
* I would like to **search a PDF (or similar format) to find my topics**, and I would like to print specific ranges of pages
* I will probably go back to the recap book when I either want to **clarify something I'm working on or want a refresher**. I don't plan on printing it out and reading the whole thing, but when I'm struggling to figure out how to do something in a few weeks, I will probably thumb through it (or do a bunch of **"edit, find" searches**). Also, I love that I'm going to be in it! So I may **use it as part of my sales efforts and point prospective clients to it**.
* on-going **reference**
* I'll download it and hopefully use it as a **reference to get some stuff done** and to fill out the notes that I took. I won't print it (because **I avoid printing stuff at all cost**)
* probably just **refer to it** on occasion and keep it on file
* I'm going to keep the book as **a searchable reference for the future**. When I think of keywords/topics, I'll search it to remind me of the talk
* Mostly likely as a **reference book**, using it when I run into an issue and looking for solutions
* Digitally, as a **reference**. There are several talks I'll want to dive into again multiple times.
* use it as a **reference**
* I keep it in digital form and **refer to it throughout the year** as I work on specific applicable areas for work
* ref guide
* reference point! **I prefer learning by reading than video or audio** and like to be able to **search documents for topics** I heard covered when they came up in the course of the following months. Also to **remember people**, so much of the value of attending an event is getting to meet people face to face. The book will help me remember speakers and build connections with them from applying what I've learned
* read the parts and **refer back from time to time**
* fresh notes on the Starter sessions. People always have different take aways than I do, so it will be interesting to see which parts you found useful. **I will use the recap book for years to come.** There was a huge amount of valuable content in the presentations this year
* I would consider printing it out - or **printing out notes on the talks I found most relevant to me**. Some of them don't apply at all to my situation.

#### Create an actions todo list

* Load it up on my **Kindle and read it cover to cover**, make highlight while reading, revisit highlights and notes after reading, create **action list** (Can do the same via your website, but **the web distracts me too much**)
* I definitely want to **act on the key takeaways from MicroConf**. I am not planning to get the book and let it sit idle to just consume space in some dusty corner of my hard-drive
* I probably won't print it out, but I'll take some time to go through it with a fine-tooth comb and **create a list of next-steps I'd like to make**
* read it all in one go and **create a ToDo list for tasks how can I improve and grow my business**. Already done something similar from your online notes, so not sure how book will be different
* I'd use it to create **a big list of actions items**, figure out which ones fit our current priorities, and start getting cranking on them
* **introduce the new ideas to my staff - so I can prove that I am not the crazy person that thought them up**. Someone has actually implemented these things successfully

### Read it cover to cover:

* I generally read books straight through in one or two sittings
* cherry pick some of the more relevant summaries and read through those pretty carefully, maybe skim some of the others. I know **it's difficult to extrapolate messages from notes when you weren't in the room**, but I'm hoping to catch one or two good bits that I can use to move forward.
* I'll **go through it once** and read the parts that are particularly interesting to me right now, then I'll come back at some point if I'm looking for **something specific**. It will be useful to have **a solid table of contents**: who gave the talk, what was it about, who could benefit from it (getting first 100 customers? scaling to 6 figures? growing your team past 10 people?)
* I wasn't at MicroConf, am a big fan of the concept, and would like to get as much value as I can from the content presented. I know a lot of this was available as the conference unfolded on your website, but **the book will allow me to dedicate time to the Starter track**. I'm not sure I'll print it, though!
* I have my **printer and a blue highlighter** with me to read through each and every word
* Not at microconf - so ever more eager to learn. **Read cover to cover** (though probably on screen)
* So I will probably **read it cover to cover on my iPad** I guess :)
* I will probably **read through it once** and then add it to my dropbox and forget it for a while
* I will undoubtedly **print it out, highlight and scribble all over it, as I always do** :)
* read it on a long flight or ocean passage. Or, if it's readable when I **send it to my kindle or phone (most PDFs aren't)** read it sooner on the couch, porch, or hammock of some rental home this summer. Honestly, I rarely read books on my laptop because I can always think of something more pressing to do when I am on my laptop. I am probably in the minority but **I do a whole lot more reading on a kindle or phone**, when I intentionally do not have my laptop in front of me
* likely print it out - but no real preference
* I probably won't print the whole PDF but I will certainly highlight it and mark it up. I will probably also **print tidbits and stick them on my home-office wall**
* I will **print out the PDF and review it with my notes and go over it with my business partner**
* **print it out and read gracefully**. Most likely I would either email to my Kindle account or import into iBooks on my iPad. It will get read, to solidify what I saw and also see what went on at growth. **I simply don't have time to watch all the videos when they come out**

### Didn't attend and want to get the takeaways:

* I **did not attend MicroConf** and actually plan to use your summary to decide if it's something I want to attend in the future
* I've **never attended a Microconf**, but I like to watch from afar. I plan to read the entire book. I'm looking forward to reading the recap about Facebook ads. Your notes about it were super interesting.
* **I did not attend this year**, but hoping to next year! Just getting started on my own journey. **I love getting things printed out to read on paper** and keep in sight to ensure I use it, but most ebooks aren't formatted with printing in mind these days so it's not always feasible.
* **Catch up on everything I missed** while I was working behind the scenes :)
* I **couldn't make it this year**, but I always get something out of the conference. Just trying to keep a toe in. It's going on my kindle for bedtime perusal.
* I'll be using the recap book to feel like I was at MicroConf (though I had to miss this year) and use it for takeaways
* **reading through talks I didn't see (I only went to starter)**, refreshing my memory for talks I did see, with a notebook next to me writing down the big takeaways that I missed during the live talks, **try really really hard not to let it rot in my Downloads folder**. not gonna lie though, that's a real risk
* **I didn't attend microconf, so I will probably read the whole thing cover to cover**. Especially the stuff from the starter sessions, maybe skim the content from the growth sessions
* I **couldn't make it to Microconf** this year, so I am still hoping to find some **actionable takeaways** for my business. Specifically, I working on a brand that will provide products and services to Shopify merchants to want to spend more while working less.
* **learn about the sessions from Growth** that I missed
* a way to learn stuff that was said at micro conf this year

### Skim

* organize by technical/inspirational
* **Reading a couple talks** every now and then if I get bored, along with referencing some of the topics touched on by the speakers
* it will sit nicely in my download folder with a "read" label. Likely I will **read the first section or two** then look for names or talks I like then bookmark the rest to come back to. Does depend the length and how it reads though
* I'm probably going to download it, **browse it for 2 minutes** and save it to read later but never get around to reading it :-)
* **read intro paragraph or two**, keep reading if interested, scan rest if less interested (and read more again if re interested)
* Wasn't at Microconf, so I don't have a takeaway. I would have liked to go, so I'm hoping to use the book to **skim the content of the conference**, and if anything seems particularly good I'll be able to **find that speaker online and look into their other content**
* I hope that the recap book will help me **stay motivated**.

### Learn how to start a business

* I'm interested in the starter topics that line up with my goal to earn money not tied to hours worked. I collect and review these regularly as needed.
* Gonna read it and **try to figure out how to start a business**
* **interested in bootstrapping** and the pragmatic advice that comes out of these cohorts
