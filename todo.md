# User research

## Takeaways

* refining of my marketing pitch. I was previously talking way too technically and it is too difficult to sell security. People need to immediately understand the actual impact to their company
* content (copy, seo and content for marketing like podcast and blogs) matters
* I need to try getting to the EU version (of microconf) as a goal
* think less about th eproduct and think more about business part - customers, finances, marketing, branding, positioning etc.
* Interview our customers to understand how they view us. We have a survey going out today
* how to structure my SaaS trial (tie payment to a key feature rather than time)
* I found the advice on **content development** to be particularly helpful
* I really liked Mocja's FB tips: facebook ads mistakes
* **talking to potential customers** via where they are likely to be: Linkedin and asking for feedback on the problems they are running into. Grind, measure, adjust, repeat.
* definitely that we need to start going more **integration marketing**. It may start off with a Zapier integration and then progress from there.
* I need to build a **referral program** into my product, and I need to couple it with cash incentives
* where to take my business and finding the right fit for your audience, product, and you
* do big things systematically
* rising above the trees to be able to think about my business at 20,000 feet.
* customer success is really just sales in a different uniform, some different demo strategies, strong-arm growth
* **engaging your audience doesn't have to be spammy**. You can use humor and reach out to people, they will be happy you took the time. I rushed home and added an email confirmation for when people upload with an offer code, so they could use the site themselves someday. Not high pressure, just a friendly "thanks for contributing, here's a coupon"
* customer needs are totally different from businesses needs. They're all about desire and that's a whole different ballgame.
* from a mastermind group dinner: that my product is releasable even if its sucks, because I can just market it more narrowl
* focusing on the audience. Audience first! I think the surprising take away I had was that I want to do more in the founder community (hence the reflections series)
* marketing before building
* help people where they are (specifically, try tweeting valuable code screenshots as a way of growing my twitter following), PAY ATTENTION to the response from blog articles, videos, tweets - and act on that info by creating similar content. Too often I look at traffic spikes, likes, and good comments as "oh yay, someone liked my thing!" and then I forget about it. Catalog good feedback from everywhere (twitter, email, ...) in one place to use later.
* **How they set sales metrics up and executed them**. I was kind of disappointed that **design wasn't touched upon**. One speaker mentioned they had a noticable revenue increase after optimizing their checkout page and I feel that topic should be discussed more. We always talk about sales funnels but not the design of the product or service. I think that's important too.
* Growth is a big deal and relying just on organic is not enough, not by a long-shot. Even as my high-school's top math student I failed to grasp the significance of compound interest (I never bought a house) - growth is hard work but the returns are there. Garret Dimon's talk was a standout. It was very moving and personal and he also managed to draw brilliant parallels between his personal struggles and business struggles. I can totally relate to the allegory of those lessons for my business life. Every talk had massive value. There were no "dud" talks. Growth means a lot to me now because I launch in 4 days and I'm 51, I don't have 10 years to grow my things before I get started on adulting.
* I need to be **even more focused on growth as a thing in itself** not just "if you build it they will come"
* getting to know the audience and product validation.
* being more creating in acquiring leads/customers. we've concentrated our efforts on events and referrals from old clients. Now we want to experiment on **content marketing and cold emails** for the moment.
* **When Adam Wathan talked about using Twitter to build an audience**. I have been off Twitter for a few years and struggling with self-promotion, and that tiny tidbit Adam offered gave me a whole new focus for the next few months.
* increase LTV and decrease customer + revenue churn
* **simply getting remotivated**
* the importance of incremental changes
* very tactical - I need to increase scarcity in my sales email in my mini-course-funnel to sell more. High-level stuff, such as the importance of founder/market-fit which I think was a great way of framing something I thought about but being unable to articulate as clearly.
* I'm not doing nearly enough customer outreach, and that I really need a mid-tier info product on my stairway. Right now I've got "free" and "pretty expensive"
* https://hunter.io/ lets you find email addresses of any professional

## Use

* I've never attended a Microconf, but I like to watch from afar. I plan to read the entire book. I'm looking foward to reading the recap about Facebook ads. Your notes about it were super interesting.
* keep the digital copy handy as a reference as I begin to implement some of the great ideas and tactics I learned about at MicroConf this year. I'm also looking forward to reading the recaps from the growth side of the conference, which I have no doubt will be interesting and informational even if my business isn't quite at that stage yet.
* Load it up on my **Kindle and read it cover to cover**, make highlight while reading, revisit highlights and notes after reading, create action list (Can do the same via your website, but **the web distracts me too much**)
* I plan to use the recap book as a reference - and as a way of getting inspiration. The more info, the better :)
* I would like to search a PDF (or similar format) to find my topics, and I would like to print specific ranges of pages
* I definitely want to act on the key takeaways from MicroConf. I am not planning to get the book and let it sit idle to just consume space in some dusty corner of my hard-drive
* interested in bootstrapping and the pragmatic advice that comes out of these cohorts
* I'll go through it once and read the parts that are particularly interesting to me right now, then I'll come back at some point if I'm looking for something specific. It will be useful to have a solid table of contents: who gave the talk, what was it about, who could benefit from it (getting first 100 customers? scaling to 6 figures? growing your team past 10 people?)
* Reading a couple talks every now and then if I get bored, along with referencing some of the topics touched on by the speakers
* I hope that the recap book will help me stay motivated.
* I wasn't at MicroConf, am a big fan of the concept, and would like to get as much value as I can from the content presented. **I know a lot of this was available as the conference unfolded on your website, but the book will allow me to dedicate time to the Starter track**. I'm not sure I'll print it, though!
* I probably won't print it out, but I'll take some time to go through it with a fine-tooth comb and **create a list of next-steps I'd like to make**
* I will probably go back to the recap book when I either want to **clarify something I'm working on or want a refresher**. I don't plan on printing it out and reading teh whole thing, but when I'm struggling to figure out how to do something in a few weeks, I will probably thumb through it (or do a bunch of "edit, find" searches). Also, I love that I'm going to be in it! So I may use it as part of my sales efforts and point prospective clients to it.
* I have my printer and a blue highlighter with me to read through each and every word
* take notes for my future products
* learn about the sessions from Growth that I missed
* fresh notes on the Starter sessions. People always have different take aways than I do, so it will be interesting to see which parts you found useful. **I will use the recap book for years to come.** There was a huge amount of valuable content in the presentations this year
* on-going **reference**
* a way to learn stuff that was said at micro conf this year
* it will sit nicely in my download folder with a "read" label. Likely I will read the first section or two then look for names or talks I like then bookmark the rest to come back to. Does depend the length and how it reads though
* read it all in one go and **create a ToDo list for tasks how can I improve and grow my business**. Already done something similar from your online notes, so not sure how book will be different
* I'll download it and hopefully use it as a **reference to get some stuff done** and to fill out the notes that I took. I won't print it (because **I avoid printing stuff at all cost**)
* I did not attend this year, but hoping to next year! Just getting started on my own journey. **I love getting things printed out to read on paper** and keep in sight to ensure I use it, but most ebooks aren't formatted with printing in mind these days so it's not always feasible.
* I would consider printing it out - or **printing out notes on the talks I found most relevant to me**. Some of them don't apply at all to my situation.
* Not at microconf - so ever more eager to learn. **Read cover to cover** (though probably on screen)
* probably just refer to it on occasion and keep it on file
* I'm going to keep the book as **a searchable reference for the future**. When I think of keywords/topics, I'll search it to remind me of the talk
* Mostly likely as a **reference book**, using it when I run into an issue and looking for solutions
* So I will probably **read it cover to cover on my iPad** I guess :)
* I'd use it to create **a big list of actions items**, figure out which ones fit our current priorities, and start getting cranking on them
* Digitally, as a **reference**. There are several talks I'll want to dive into again multiple times.
* **Catch up on everything I missed** while I was working behind the scenes :)
* I'm probably going to download it, browse it for 2 minutes and save it to read later but never get around to reading it :-)
* use it as a **reference**
* I couldn't make it this year, but I always get something out of the conference. Just trying to keep a toe in. It's going on my kindle for bedtime perusal.
* read intro paragraph or two, keep reading if interested, scan rest if less interested (and read more again if re interested)
* Wasn't at Microconf, so I don't have a takeaway. I would have liked to go, so I'm hoping to use the book to **skim the content of the conference**, and if anything seems particularly good I'll be able to **find that speaker online and look into their other content**
* I keep it in digital form and **refer to it throughout the year** as I work on specific applicable areas for work
* ref guide
* **introduce the new ideas to my staff - so I can prove that I am not the crazy person that thought them up**. Someone has actually implemented these things successfully
* I will probably read through it once and then add it to my dropbox and forget it for a while
* I'll be using the recap book to feel like I was at MicroConf (though I had to miss this year) and use it for takeaways
* I will undoubtedly **print it out, highlight and scribble all over it, as I always do** :)
* read it on a long flight or ocean passage. Or, if it's readable when I **send it to my kindle or phone (most PDFs aren't)** read it sooner on the couch, porch, or hammock of some rental home this summer. Honestly, I rarely read books on my laptop because I can always think of something more pressing to do when I am on my laptop. I am probably in the minority but I do a whole lot more reading on a kindle or phone, when I intentionally do not have my laptop in front of me
* reference point! I prefer learning by reading than video or audio and like to be able to search documents for topics I heard covered when they came up in the course of the following months. Also to **remember people**, so much of the value of attending an event is getting to meet people face to face. The book will help me remember speakers and build connections with them from applying what I've learned
* read the parts and refer back from time to time
* reading through talks I didn't see (I only went to starter), refreshing my memory for talks I did see, with a notebook next to me writing down the big takeaways that I missed during the live talks, **try really really hard not to let it rot in my Downloads folder**. not gonna lie though, that's a real risk
* likely print it out - but no real preference
* I'm taking a copywriting class and I plan on using your book to add to that knowledge.
* I probably won't print the whole PDF but I will certainly highlight it and mark it up. I will probably also **print tidbits and stick them on my home-office wall**
* I will **print out the PDF and review it with my notes and go over it with my business partner**
* print it out and read gracefully. Most likely I would either email to my Kindle account or import into iBooks on my iPad. It will get read, to solidify what I saw and also see what went on at growth. **I simply don't have time to watch all the videos when they come out**
* I didn't attend microconf, so I will probably read the whole thing cover to cover. Especially the stuff from the starter sessions, maybe skim the content from the growth sessions
